# Upbound Universal Crossplane (UXP)

Upbound Universal Crossplane (UXP) is [Upbound's](https://upbound.io) official
enterprise-grade distribution of [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io). It's fully compatible
with upstream Crossplane, open source, capable of connecting to Upbound Cloud
for real-time dashboard visibility, and maintained by Upbound. It's the easiest
