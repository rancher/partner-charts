# Apache APISIX for Kubernetes

[Apache APISIX](https://apisix.apache.org/) is a dynamic, real-time, high-performance API gateway.

[APISIX](https://github.com/apache/apisix/) provides rich traffic management features such as load balancing, dynamic upstream, canary release, circuit breaking, authentication, observability, and more.

You can use Apache APISIX to handle traditional north-south traffic, as well as east-west traffic between services. It can also be used as a [k8s ingress controller](https://github.com/apache/apisix-ingress-controller/).
