# TriggerMesh AWS Event Sources

The [TriggerMesh Cloud Native Integration Platform](https://github.com/triggermesh/aws-event-sources) consists of a set of APIs which allows you to build event-driven applications with Knative. Implemented as a set of Kubernetes CRDs and a Kubernetes controller, it gives you a way to declaratively define your event sources and event targets, in addition to potential actions needed in your applications: content-based event filtering, event splitting, event transformation and event processing via functions.
