# NetScaler Observability Exporter

[NetScaler Observability Exporter](https://docs.netscaler.com/en-us/netscaler-observability-exporter.html) is a container which collects metrics and transactions from NetScalers and transforms them to suitable formats (such as JSON, AVRO) for supported endpoints.

This chart bootstraps standalone NetScaler Observability Exporter which can be used to collect metrics from NetScaler MPX or VPX or CPX.
