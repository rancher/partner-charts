# Dynatrace OneAgent Operator

This is the home of the Dynatrace OneAgent Operator's Helm Chart which supports the rollout and lifecycle of [Dynatrace OneAgent](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/get-started/introduction/what-is-oneagent/) in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.
Rolling out Dynatrace OneAgent via DaemonSet on a cluster is straightforward.
Maintaining its lifecycle places a burden on the operational team.
Dynatrace OneAgent Operator closes this gap by automating the repetitive steps involved in keeping Dynatrace OneAgent at its latest desired version.
