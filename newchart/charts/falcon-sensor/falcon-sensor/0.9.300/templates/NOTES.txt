Thank you for installing the CrowdStrike Falcon Helm Chart!

Access to the Falcon Linux and Container Sensor downloads at https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/hosts/sensor-downloads are
required to complete the install of this Helm chart. This is provided automatically to all active CrowdStrike customers.
Additionally, a containerized sensor must be present in a container registry accessible from Kubernetes installation.
Sample Dockerfiles are available at https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Dockerfiles.
CrowdStrike Falcon sensors will deploy across all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster after
installing this Helm chart. An extremely common error on installation is accidentally
forgetting to add your containerized sensor to your local image registry prior to executing
`helm install`. The default image name to deploy a kernel sensor to a node is `falcon-node-sensor`.
