## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

Citrix ADC CPX can act as a sidecar proxy to an application container in Istio. You can inject the Citrix ADC CPX manually or automatically using the [Istio sidecar injector](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/). Automatic sidecar injection requires resources including a Kubernetes [mutating webhook admission](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/) controller, and a service. Using this Helm chart, you can create resources required for automatically deploying Citrix ADC CPX as a sidecar proxy.

In Istio servicemesh, the namespace must be labelled before applying the deployment yaml for [automatic sidecar injection](https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/additional-setup/sidecar-injection/#automatic-sidecar-injection). Once the namespace is labelled, sidecars (envoy or CPX) will be injected while creating pods.
- For CPX, namespace must be labelled `cpx-injection=enabled`
- For Envoy, namespace must be labelled `istio-injection=enabled`

__Note: If a namespace is labelled with both `istio-injection` and `cpx-injection`, Envoy injection takes a priority! Citrix CPX won't be injected on top of the already injected Envoy sidecar. For using Citrix ADC as sidecar, ensure that `istio-injection` label is removed from the namespace.__

For detailed information on different deployment options, see [Deployment Architecture](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-istio-adaptor/blob/master/docs/istio-integration/architecture.md).

### Compatibility Matrix between Citrix xDS-adaptor and Istio version

Below table provides info about recommended Citrix xDS-Adaptor version to be used for various Istio versions.

| Citrix xDS-Adaptor version | Istio version |
|----------------------------|---------------|
| quay.io/citrix/citrix-xds-adaptor:0.10.3 | Istio v1.14+ |
| quay.io/citrix/citrix-xds-adaptor:0.10.1 | Istio v1.12 to Istio v1.13 |
| quay.io/citrix/citrix-xds-adaptor:0.9.9 | Istio v1.10 to Istio v1.11 |
| quay.io/citrix/citrix-xds-adaptor:0.9.8 | Istio v1.8 to Istio v1.9 |
| quay.io/citrix/citrix-xds-adaptor:0.9.5 | Istio v1.6 |

### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for deploying Citrix ADC as a sidecar to an application pod.

- Ensure that **Istio version 1.8 onwards** is installed
- Ensure that Helm with version 3.x is installed. Follow this [step](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-helm-charts/blob/master/Helm_Installation_version_3.md) to install the same.
- Ensure that your cluster Kubernetes version should be 1.16 onwards and the `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1`, `admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1` API is enabled

You can verify the API by using the following command:

        kubectl api-versions | grep admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1

The following output indicates that the API is enabled:

        admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1
        admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1beta1

- Create namespace `citrix-system`
        
        kubectl create namespace citrix-system
        
- **Registration of Citrix ADC CPX in ADM**

Create a secret containing ADM username and password in each application namespace.

        kubectl create secret generic admlogin --from-literal=username=<adm-username> --from-literal=password=<adm-password> -n citrix-system

## <a name="deploy-sidecar-injector-for-citrix-adc-cpx-using-helm-chart">Deploy Sidecar Injector for Citrix ADC CPX using Helm chart</a>

**Before you Begin**

To deploy resources for automatic installation of Citrix ADC CPX as a sidecar in Istio, perform the following step. In this example, release name is specified as `cpx-sidecar-injector`  and namespace is used as `citrix-system`.


    helm repo add citrix https://citrix.github.io/citrix-helm-charts/

    helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES

This step installs a mutating webhook and a service resource to application pods in the namespace labeled as `cpx-injection=enabled`.

*"Note:" The `cpx-injection=enabled` label is mandatory for injecting sidecars.*

An example to deploy application along with Citrix ADC CPX sidecar is provided [here](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-helm-charts/tree/master/examples/citrix-adc-in-istio).


# <a name="observability-using-coe"> Observability using Citrix Observability Exporter </a>

### Pre-requisites

1. Citrix Observability Exporter (COE) should be deployed in the cluster.

2. Citrix ADC CPX should be running with versions 13.0-48+ or 12.1-56+.

Citrix ADC CPXes serving East West traffic send its metrics and transaction data to COE which has a support for Prometheus and Zipkin. 

Metrics data can be visualized in Prometheus dashboard. 

Zipkin enables users to analyze tracing for East-West service to service communication.

*Note*: Istio should be [installed](https://istio.io/docs/tasks/observability/distributed-tracing/zipkin/#before-you-begin) with Zipkin as tracing endpoint.

```
helm repo add citrix https://citrix.github.io/citrix-helm-charts/

helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES,coe.coeURL=<coe-service-name>.<namespace>
```

By default, COE is primarily used for Prometheus integration. Servicegraph and tracing is handled by Citrix ADM appliance. To enable Zipkin tracing, set argument `coe.coeTracing=true` in helm command. Default value of coeTracing is set to false.

```
helm repo add citrix https://citrix.github.io/citrix-helm-charts/

helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES,coe.coeURL=<coe-service-name>.<namespace>,coe.coeTracing=true

```

For example, if COE is deployed as `coe` in `citrix-system` namespace, then below helm command will deploy sidecar injector webhook which will be deploying Citrix ADC CPX sidecar proxies in application pods, and these sidecar proxies will be configured to establish communication channels with COE.

```
helm repo add citrix https://citrix.github.io/citrix-helm-charts/

helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES,coe.coeURL=coe.citrix-system
```

*Important*: Apply below mentioned annotations on COE deployment so that Prometheus can scrape data from COE.
```
        prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
        prometheus.io/port: "5563" # Prometheus port
```
## <a name="citrix-adc-cpx-license-provisioning">**Citrix ADC CPX License Provisioning**</a>
By default, CPX runs with 20 Mbps bandwidth called as [CPX Express](https://www.citrix.com/en-in/products/citrix-adc/cpx-express.html) however for better performance and production deployment customer needs licensed CPX instances. [Citrix ADM](https://www.citrix.com/en-in/products/citrix-application-delivery-management/) is used to check out licenses for Citrix ADC CPX.

**Bandwidth based licensing**
For provisioning licensing on Citrix ADC CPX, it is mandatory to provide License Server information to CPX. This can be done by setting **ADMSettings.licenseServerIP** as License Server IP. In addition to this, **ADMSettings.bandWidthLicense** needs to be set true and desired bandwidth capacity in Mbps should be set **ADMSettings.bandWidth**.
For example, to set 2Gbps as bandwidth capacity, below command can be used.

```
helm repo add citrix https://citrix.github.io/citrix-helm-charts/

helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES --set ADMSettings.licenseServerIP=<licenseServer_IP>,ADMSettings.bandWidthLicense=True --set ADMSettings.bandWidth=2000

```

## <a name="configuration-for-servicegraph">**Service Graph configuration**</a>
   Citrix ADM Service graph is an observability tool that allows user to analyse service to service communication. The service graph is generated by ADM post collection of transactional data from registered Citrix ADC instances. More details about it can be found [here](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-application-delivery-management-service/application-analytics-and-management/service-graph.html).
   Citrix ADC needs to be provided with ADM details for registration and data export. This section lists the steps needed to deploy Citrix ADC and register it with ADM.

   1. Create secret using Citrix ADM Agent credentials, which will be used by Citrix ADC as CPX to communicate with Citrix ADM Agent:

	kubectl create secret generic admlogin --from-literal=username=<adm-agent-username> --from-literal=password=<adm-agent-password>

   2. Deploy Citrix ADC CPX sidecar injector using helm command with `ADM` details:

	helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES --set ADMSettings.ADMIP=<ADM-Agent-IP>

> **Note:**
> If container agent is being used here for Citrix ADM, specify `serviceIP` of container agent in the `ADMSettings.ADMIP` parameter.

## <a name="generate-certificate-for-application">Generate Certificate for Application </a>

Application needs TLS certificate-key pair for establishing secure communication channel with other applications. Earlier these certificates were issued by Istio Citadel and bundled in Kubernetes secret. Certificate was loaded in the application pod by doing volume mount of secret. Now `xDS-Adaptor` can generate its own certificate and get it signed by the Istio Citadel (Istiod). This eliminates the need of secret and associated [risks](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#risks). 

xDS-Adaptor needs to be provided with details Certificate Authority (CA) for successful signing of Certificate Signing Request (CSR). By default, CA is `istiod.istio-system.svc` which accepts CSRs on port 15012. 
To skip this process, don't provide any value (empty string) to `certProvider.caAddr`.
```
	helm repo add citrix https://citrix.github.io/citrix-helm-charts/

        helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES --set certProvider.caAddr=""
```

### <a name="using-third-party-service-account-tokens">Configure Third Party Service Account Tokens</a>

In order to generate certificate for application workload, xDS-Adaptor needs to send valid service account token along with Certificate Signing Request (CSR) to the Istio control plane (Citadel CA). Istio control plane authenticates the xDS-Adaptor using this JWT. 
Kubernetes supports two forms of these tokens:

* Third party tokens, which have a scoped audience and expiration.
* First party tokens, which have no expiration and are mounted into all pods.
 
 If Kubernetes cluster is installed with third party tokens, then the same information needs to be provided for automatic sidecar injection by passing `--set certProvider.jwtPolicy="third-party-jwt"`. By default, it is `first-party-jwt`.

```
        helm repo add citrix https://citrix.github.io/citrix-helm-charts/

        helm install cpx-sidecar-injector citrix/citrix-cpx-istio-sidecar-injector --namespace citrix-system --set cpxProxy.EULA=YES --set certProvider.caAddr="istiod.istio-system.svc" --set certProvider.jwtPolicy="third-party-jwt"

```

To determine if your cluster supports third party tokens, look for the TokenRequest API using below command. If there is no output, then it is `first-party-jwt`. In case of `third-party-jwt`, output will be like below.

```
# kubectl get --raw /api/v1 | jq '.resources[] | select(.name | index("serviceaccounts/token"))'

{
    "name": "serviceaccounts/token",
    "singularName": "",
    "namespaced": true,
    "group": "authentication.k8s.io",
    "version": "v1",
    "kind": "TokenRequest",
    "verbs": [
        "create"
    ]
}

```

## <a name="limitations">Limitations</a>

Citrix ADC CPX occupies certain ports for internal usage. This makes application service running on one of these restricted ports incompatible with the Citrix ADC CPX.
The list of ports is mentioned below. Citrix is working on delisting some of the major ports from the given list, and same shall be available in future releases.

#### Restricted Ports

| Sr No |Port Number|
|-------|-----------|
| 1 | 80 |
| 2 | 3010 |
| 3 | 5555 |
| 4 | 8080 |

## <a name="clean-up">Clean Up</a>
