# Citrix Ingress Controller

[Citrix Ingress Controler](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller) is an ingress controller for Citrix ADC MPX (hardware), Citrix ADC VPX (virtualized), and Citrix ADC CPX (containerized) for bare metal and cloud deployments. It is built around Kubernetes Ingress and automatically configures Citrix ADC based on the Ingress resource configuration.
