Thank you for installing the Speedscale Operator!

Next you'll need to add the Speedscale Proxy Sidecar to your deployments.
See https://docs.speedscale.com/setup/sidecar/install/

If upgrading use the rollout restart command for each namespace and resource
type to ensure Speedscale sidecars are updated:

  kubectl -n <namespace> rollout restart deployment

Once your deployment is running the sidecar your service will show up on
https://app.speedscale.com/.
