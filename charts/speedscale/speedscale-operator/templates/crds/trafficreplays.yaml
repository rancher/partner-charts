                      description: |-
                        Tests are strings used to identify slices of inbound snapshot traffic this
                        workload is targeting and maps directly to a snapshot's `InTraffic` field.
                        Snapshot ingress traffic can be split across multiple slices where each
                        slice contains part of the traffic.  A key must only be specified once
                        across all workloads, but a workload may specify multiple keys.


                        Test strings may only match part of the snapshot's `InTraffic` key if the
                        string matches exactly one key. For example, the test string
                        `foo.example.com` would match the `InTraffic` key of
                        my-service:foo.example.com:8080, as long as no other keys would match
                        `foo.example.com`


                        This field is optional in the spec to provide support for single-workload
                        and legacy replays, but must be specified for multi-workload replays in
                        order to provide deterministic replay configuration.
