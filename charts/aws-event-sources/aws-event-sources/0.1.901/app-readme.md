# TriggerMesh AWS Event Sources

[aws-event-sources](https://github.com/triggermesh/aws-event-sources) is a Kubernetes controller that implements Knative event sources for AWS services.

You may be using some Cloud services on AWS but still interested to run workloads within Kubernetes. To trigger those workloads when events happen in your AWS service you need to have an event source that can consume AWS events and send them to your workload.
