# Name of the nodepool in which the Quobyte services will be deployed.
# A separate nodepool can be used for performance isolation to avoid
# other workloads from impacting your storage.
# You can create a nodepool by labeling worker nodes
# "kubectl label nodes <your-node-name> storage-node-pool=quobyte"
## nodepoolname: quobyte

# Configuration for the Quobyte services, i.e. the Quobyte cluster providing storage.
quobyte:
  # Loadbalancer to make the Quobyte webconsole accessible.
  # If set to true an internal IP will be used, if set to false an external IP will be used
  # the exact semantics of internal/external depend on your k8s config or provider.
  lbinternal: false 
  
  # Configuration for the persistent disks used by the Quobyte services.
  # Storage provisioner depending to the cloud environment:
  # storageProvisioner: "kubernetes.io/aws-ebs"
  # storageProvisioner: "kubernetes.io/azure-disk" 
  storageProvisioner: "kubernetes.io/gce-pd"
  # Storage type, also depending on the used environment:
  # flashStorage: "gp2"           # AWS general purpose SSD
  # flashStorage: "Standard_LRS"  # Azure "Standard Locally Redundant Storage"
  # flashStorage: "pd-ssd"        # GCE SSD storage
  flashStorage: "pd-ssd"

  # Minimum number of replicas per Quobyte services, minimum is 3.
  # Your nodepool must have at least 3 nodes.
  replicas: 3
  
  # Data disks attached to each Quobyte data services, minimum is one data disk,
  # maximum is 16. Please note that adding more data disks will increase capacity,
  # but not necessarily the performance of your Quobyte cluster.
  # The name MUST start with "data".
  # The mount point MUST start with "/var/lib/quobyte/devices/data..." and the last
  # part MUST match the disk name. E.g. if the name is "data5" the mountpoint
  # must be "/var/lib/quobyte/devices/data5".
  # The minimum capacity of a disk must be 100Gi, recommended size depends on the
  # cloud environment, e.g. 840Gi for Google Persistent SSDs.
  datadisks:
    - name: data0
      mountpoint: /var/lib/quobyte/devices/data0
      size: "840Gi"
    - name: data1
      mountpoint: /var/lib/quobyte/devices/data1
      size: "840Gi"
  
  # Metadata disks attached to each Quobyte metadata service, minimum is one
  # metadata disk. Similar to datadisks, names MUST start with "metadata".
  # Minimum capacity is 100Gi, recommended size depends on the cloud environment.
  # Please make sure to use SSDs or media with similar peformance characteristics.
  metadatadisks:
    - name: metadata0
      mountpoint: /var/lib/quobyte/devices/metadata0
      size: "100Gi"
      
  # Set enabled to start the Quobyte S3 service. Requires a properly
  # configured domain name.
  # As S3 is an HTTP-based protocol, it requires a correct DNS hostname setup. 
  # Generally the S3 service will be available under a specific hostname such as s3.example.com. 
  # Buckets can be addressed as a subdomain of the host e.g., <bucket name>.s3.example.com.
  #
  # HTTP requires a setup of both the S3 hostname and a wildcard hostname for subdomains in your DNS
  # infrastructure which points to the machine or machines running the S3 Proxy. 
  # So at a minimum, there are two CNAME records that point to a machine running the S3 proxy
  s3:
    enabled: false 
    dnsname: s3.example.com
