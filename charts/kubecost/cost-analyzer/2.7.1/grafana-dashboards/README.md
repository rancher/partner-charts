# Kubecost Grafana Dashboards

## Overview

Kubecost, by default, is bundled with a Grafana instance that already contains the dashboards in this folder.

The dashboards in this repo are imported into Kubecost, unless disabled with


The same dashboards have template versions in [grafana-templates/](grafana-templates/) for those wanting to load the dashboards into an existing Grafana instance.

## Caveats

The primary purpose of the dashboards provided is to allow visibility into the metrics used by Kubecost to create the cost-model.

The networkCosts-metrics dashboard requires the optional networkCosts daemonset to be [enabled](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/kubecost/self-hosted/2.x?topic=configuration-network-cost).

## Metrics Required

`kubecost-container-stats` metrics:

```
container_cpu_usage_seconds_total
kube_pod_container_resource_requests
container_memory_working_set_bytes
container_cpu_cfs_throttled_periods_total

```

`network-transfer-data` metrics:

```
kubecost_pod_network_ingress_bytes_total
kubecost_pod_network_egress_bytes_total
```

`disk-usage` metrics:
