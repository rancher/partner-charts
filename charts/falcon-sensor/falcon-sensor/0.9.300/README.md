# CrowdStrike Falcon Helm Chart

[Falcon](https://www.crowdstrike.com/) is the [CrowdStrike](https://www.crowdstrike.com/)
platform purpose-built to stop breaches via a unified set of cloud-delivered
technologies that prevent all types of attacks â€” including malware and much
more.

# Kubernetes Cluster Compatability

The Falcon Helm chart has been tested to deploy on the following Kubernetes distributions:

* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)
* Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) - Linux Nodes Only
* Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
* Rancher K3s
  * Nodes must be Linux distributions supported by CrowdStrike. See [https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/20/falcon-sensor-for-linux#operating-systems](https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/support/documentation/20/falcon-sensor-for-linux#operating-systems) for supported Linux distributions and kernels.
* Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.6+

# Dependencies

1. Requires a x86_64 Kubernetes cluster
1. Must be a CrowdStrike customer with access to the Falcon Linux Sensor and Falcon Container downloads.
1. Before deploying the Helm chart, you should have a Falcon Linux Sensor in the container registry before installing the Helm Chart. See the Deployment Considerations for more.
1. Helm 3.x is installed and supported by the Kubernetes vendor.

# Deployment Considerations

To ensure a successful deployment, you will want to ensure that:
1. By default, the Helm Chart installs in the `default` namespace. Best practices for deploying to Kubernetes is to create a new namespace. This can be done by adding `-n falcon-system --create-namespace` to your `helm install` command.
1. You have access to a containerized falcon sensor image. This is most likely through a private image registry on your network or cloud provider. See [https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Dockerfiles](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/Dockerfiles) as an example of how to build a Falcon sensor for your registry.
1. The Falcon Linux Sensor (not the Falcon Container) should be used in the container image to deploy to Kubernetes nodes.
1. When deploying the Falcon Linux Sensor to a node, the container image should match the node's operating system. For example, if the node is running Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2, the container image should be based on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.2, etc. This is important to ensure sensor and image compatibility with the base node operating system.
1. You must have sufficient permissions to deploy Helm Charts to the cluster. This is often received through cluster admin privileges.
1. Only deploying to Kubernetes nodes are supported at this time.
1. When deploying the Falcon Linux Sensor as a container to Kubernetes nodes, it is a requirement that the Falcon Sensor run as a privileged container so that the Sensor can properly work with the kernel. If this is unacceptable, you can install the Falcon Linux Sensor (still runs with privileges) using an RPM or DEB package on the nodes themselves. This assumes that you have the capability to actually install RPM or DEB packages on the nodes. If you do not have this capability and you want to protect the nodes, you have to install using a privileged container.
1. CrowdStrike's Helm Operator is a project, not a product, and released to the community as a way to automate sensor deployment to kubernetes clusters. The upstream repository for this project is [https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-helm](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-helm).

# Installation

### Add the CrowdStrike Falcon Helm repository

```
helm repo add crowdstrike https://crowdstrike.github.io/falcon-helm
```

### Install CrowdStrike Falcon Helm Chart

```
helm upgrade --install falcon-helm crowdstrike/falcon-sensor \
    --set falcon.cid="<CrowdStrike_CID>" \
    --set node.image.repository="<Your_Registry>/falcon-node-sensor"
```

Above command will install the CrowdStrike Falcon Helm Chart with the release name `falcon-helm` in the namespace your `kubectl` context is currently set to.
You can install also install into a customized namespace by running the following:

```
helm upgrade --install falcon-helm crowdstrike/falcon-sensor \
    -n falcon-system --create-namespace \
    --set falcon.cid="<CrowdStrike_CID>" \
    --set node.image.repository="<Your_Registry>/falcon-node-sensor"
```

For more details please see the [falcon-helm](https://github.com/CrowdStrike/falcon-helm) repository.

## Node Configuration

The following tables lists the more common configurable parameters of the chart and their default values for installing on a Kubernetes node.

| Parameter                       | Description                                                          | Default                                   |
|:--------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------- |
| `node.enabled`                  | Enable installation on the Kubernetes node                           | `true`                                    |
| `node.image.repository`         | Falcon Sensor Node registry/image name                               | `falcon-node-sensor`                      |
| `node.image.tag`                | The version of the official image to use                             | `latest`                                  |
| `node.image.pullPolicy`         | Policy for updating images                                           | `Always`                                  |
| `node.image.pullSecrets`        | Pull secrets for private registry                                    | `{}`                                      |

`falcon.cid` and `node.image.repository` are required values.

### Uninstall Helm Chart
To uninstall, run the following command:
```
helm uninstall falcon-helm
```

To uninstall from a custom namespace, run the following command:
```
helm uninstall falcon-helm -n falcon-system
```
