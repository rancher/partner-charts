            DenyRules configures request filtering using Airlock built-in and custom deny rules.
            Deny rules establish a negative security model. They define prohibited patterns which, when a match is found in a request, lead to it being blocked from reaching the upstream web application.
            To handle possible false positives, lower the security level or define fine-granular deny rule exceptions
            If undefined, default settings are applied, designed to work with most upstream web application services.
