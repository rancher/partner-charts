            CustomResponsePolicy is a Direct Attached Policy for the Kubernetes Gateway API.
            It defines a rule-based policy for replacing local responses with custom responses.
            Note: For requests matching any valid HTTPRoute to which the policy is attached, the policy fully overrides any global custom response configuration in GatewayParameters (no merging).

                              responses specifies the local response customization rules to apply when the request matches this policy.

                              The rules are processed as follows:
                              - The first rule (from top to bottom) where the statusCodeCondition matches the local response's status code determines the custom response to be sent.
                              - If no rule matches (or if no rules are defined), the Gateway will send default responses.

                              Default error responses, available as `text/html`, `application/json` and `text/plain` (fallback):
                              - 401 -> built-in 401 response
                              - 403 -> built-in 403 response
                              - 404 -> built-in 404 response
                              - 429 -> built-in 429 response
                              - 4xx -> built-in 400 response (status code replaced with 400)
                              - 5xx -> built-in 5xx response (status code preserved for 502-504, others replaced with 500)

                              If you wish to customize all built-in error responses, we recommend at least the following set of rules as a starting point:

                              - 403 (CSRF protection, wrong scheme)
                              - 404 (request does not match any route)
                              - 408 (request timeout)
                              - 429 (community rate limit reached)
                              - 500 (invalid route/backend/policy configuration)
                              - 502 | 503 (other errors)
                              - 504 (backend timeout)

                              Note: If EnvoyExtensionPolicy is allowed, custom filters may generate arbitrary local responses.

                  description: |-
                    Ancestors is a list of ancestor resources (usually Gateways) that are
                    associated with the policy, and the status of the policy with respect to
                    each ancestor. When this policy attaches to a parent, the controller that
                    manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                    the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                    appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                    Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                    an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                    which to namespace this status.

                    Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                    the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                    use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                    that they are responsible for.

                    Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                    MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                    and ControllerName fields combined.

                    A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                    If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                    Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                    on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                    here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                    additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                    the BackendTLSPolicy.

                    description: |-
                      PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                      associated Ancestor.

                      Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                      in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                      Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                      the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                      useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                      SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                      have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                      In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                      resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                      targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                      Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                      ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                      Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                      implementations.

                      For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                      used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                      In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                      ancestor object referred to in this status.

                      Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                      relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                      This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                      with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"

                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a

                              as opposed to a listener(s) whose port(s) may be changed. When both Port
                              and SectionName are specified, the name and port of the selected listener
                              must match both specified values.

                              When the parent resource is a Service, this targets a specific port in the
                              Service spec. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName are specified,
                              the name and port of the selected port must match both specified values.

                              Implementations MAY choose to support other parent resources.
                              Implementations supporting other types of parent resources MUST clearly
                              document how/if Port is interpreted.

                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful as
                              long as the parent resource accepts it partially. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment
                              from the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                              SectionName is the name of a section within the target resource. In the
                              following resources, SectionName is interpreted as the following:

                              * Gateway: Listener name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName
                              are specified, the name and port of the selected listener must match
                              both specified values.
                              * Service: Port name. When both Port (experimental) and SectionName

                              both specified values.

                              Implementations MAY choose to support attaching Routes to other resources.
                              If that is the case, they MUST clearly document how SectionName is
                              interpreted.

                              When unspecified (empty string), this will reference the entire resource.
                              For the purpose of status, an attachment is considered successful if at
                              least one section in the parent resource accepts it. For example, Gateway
                              listeners can restrict which Routes can attach to them by Route kind,
                              namespace, or hostname. If 1 of 2 Gateway listeners accept attachment from
                              the referencing Route, the Route MUST be considered successfully
                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route, the
                              Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.
