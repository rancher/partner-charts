                                            Value of the claim. If not specified, only existence of the claim is checked (any value is allowed).

                                            Value matching is only supported if the data type of the claim is either primitive (`number`, `boolean`, `string`) or `array` of primitives.
                                            In case of a non-string value, the match will be performed against the stringified value.

                                            If the claim has an unsupported data type (e.g. `object` or `null`), its value will never match.

                    manages the parent and the ancestors MUST add an entry to this list when
                    the controller first sees the policy and SHOULD update the entry as
                    appropriate when the relevant ancestor is modified.

                    Note that choosing the relevant ancestor is left to the Policy designers;
                    an important part of Policy design is designing the right object level at
                    which to namespace this status.

                    Note also that implementations MUST ONLY populate ancestor status for
                    the Ancestor resources they are responsible for. Implementations MUST
                    use the ControllerName field to uniquely identify the entries in this list
                    that they are responsible for.

                    Note that to achieve this, the list of PolicyAncestorStatus structs
                    MUST be treated as a map with a composite key, made up of the AncestorRef
                    and ControllerName fields combined.

                    A maximum of 16 ancestors will be represented in this list. An empty list
                    means the Policy is not relevant for any ancestors.

                    If this slice is full, implementations MUST NOT add further entries.
                    Instead they MUST consider the policy unimplementable and signal that
                    on any related resources such as the ancestor that would be referenced
                    here. For example, if this list was full on BackendTLSPolicy, no
                    additional Gateways would be able to reference the Service targeted by
                    the BackendTLSPolicy.

                      PolicyAncestorStatus describes the status of a route with respect to an
                      associated Ancestor.

                      Ancestors refer to objects that are either the Target of a policy or above it
                      in terms of object hierarchy. For example, if a policy targets a Service, the
                      Policy's Ancestors are, in order, the Service, the HTTPRoute, the Gateway, and
                      the GatewayClass. Almost always, in this hierarchy, the Gateway will be the most
                      useful object to place Policy status on, so we recommend that implementations
                      SHOULD use Gateway as the PolicyAncestorStatus object unless the designers
                      have a _very_ good reason otherwise.

                      In the context of policy attachment, the Ancestor is used to distinguish which
                      resource results in a distinct application of this policy. For example, if a policy
                      targets a Service, it may have a distinct result per attached Gateway.

                      Policies targeting the same resource may have different effects depending on the
                      ancestors of those resources. For example, different Gateways targeting the same
                      Service may have different capabilities, especially if they have different underlying
                      implementations.

                      For example, in BackendTLSPolicy, the Policy attaches to a Service that is
                      used as a backend in a HTTPRoute that is itself attached to a Gateway.
                      In this case, the relevant object for status is the Gateway, and that is the
                      ancestor object referred to in this status.

                      Note that a parent is also an ancestor, so for objects where the parent is the
                      relevant object for status, this struct SHOULD still be used.

                      This struct is intended to be used in a slice that's effectively a map,
                      with a composite key made up of the AncestorRef and the ControllerName.

                              boundaries. Cross-namespace references are only valid if they are explicitly
                              allowed by something in the namespace they are referring to. For example:
                              Gateway has the AllowedRoutes field, and ReferenceGrant provides a
                              generic way to enable any other kind of cross-namespace reference.

                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in the same namespace are "producer"
                              routes, which apply default routing rules to inbound connections from
                              any namespace to the Service.

                              ParentRefs from a Route to a Service in a different namespace are
                              "consumer" routes, and these routing rules are only applied to outbound
                              connections originating from the same namespace as the Route, for which
                              the intended destination of the connections are a Service targeted as a
                              ParentRef of the Route.

                              When the parent resource is a Gateway, this targets all listeners

                              attached. If no Gateway listeners accept attachment from this Route,
                              the Route MUST be considered detached from the Gateway.

                          ControllerName is a domain/path string that indicates the name of the
                          controller that wrote this status. This corresponds with the
                          controllerName field on GatewayClass.

                          Example: "example.net/gateway-controller".

                          The format of this field is DOMAIN "/" PATH, where DOMAIN and PATH are
                          valid Kubernetes names
                          (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names).

                          Controllers MUST populate this field when writing status. Controllers should ensure that
                          entries to status populated with their ControllerName are cleaned up when they are no
                          longer necessary.
