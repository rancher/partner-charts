Helm does not automatically upgrade CRDs from the chart's 'crds/' directory during 'helm install/upgrade'.
Therefore, the CRDs must be manually upgraded with the following command before deploying this chart:

kubectl apply -k https://github.com/airlock/microgateway/deploy/charts/airlock-microgateway/crds/?ref=%s --server-side --force-conflicts

If you are not using the helm install/upgrade command and instead rely on some other mechanism which is able to upgrade CRDs for deploying this chart, you can suppress this error by setting the helm value 'crds.skipVersionCheck=true'.`
