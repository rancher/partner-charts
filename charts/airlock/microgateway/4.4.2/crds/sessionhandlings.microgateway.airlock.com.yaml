                    Prefix specifies the prefix under which the sessions should be stored in the persistence layer.
                    If not specified, an automatic prefix derived from the namespaced SessionHandling CR name is used, which ensures that sessions will always be isolated on Microgateways configured with different SessionHandling CRs, even if they share the same persistence backend.

                    To allow session sharing between different Microgateway deployments, ensure that the prefix and persistence backend is the same across all corresponding SessionHandling CRs.

                    Note: Session cookies are currently never shared across different fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) and authentication via different OIDC Relying Parties generates different session cookies. Clients will therefore only able to transparently reuse session cookies for connecting to different Microgateway deployments if those are a) exposed under the same FQDN and b) handle authentication via the same OIDC Relying Party.
