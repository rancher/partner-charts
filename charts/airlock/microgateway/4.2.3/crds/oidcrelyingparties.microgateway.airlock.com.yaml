            {{% notice warning %}} The OIDC feature is currently in an experimental state.


            We encourage you to try it out and give feedback, but be aware that we do not recommend using it in a production environment yet, as security has not yet been hardened.
            In particular, the current implementation has the following limitations, which we intend to address in future Microgateway releases:
            - The state parameter is guessable.
            - ID token and access token are stored in cookies and are thus sent to the accessing client.
