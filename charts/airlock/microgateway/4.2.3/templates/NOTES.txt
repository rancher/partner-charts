Thank you for installing Airlock Microgateway.
If you have not already done so, make sure that Airlock Microgateway CNI is also installed on the cluster.

For further information, please visit our documentation at https://docs.airlock.com/microgateway/{{ include "airlock-microgateway.docsVersion" .}}.
Detailed CRD API reference documentation is also available at https://docs.airlock.com/microgateway/{{ include "airlock-microgateway.docsVersion" .}}/api/crds.

Helm does not automatically upgrade CRDs from the chart's 'crds/' directory during 'helm install/upgrade'.
Therefore, the CRDs must be manually upgraded with the following command before deploying this chart:

kubectl apply -k https://github.com/airlock/microgateway/deploy/charts/airlock-microgateway/crds/?ref=%s --server-side --force-conflicts

If you are not using the helm install/upgrade command and instead rely on some other mechanism which is able to upgrade CRDs for deploying this chart, you can suppress this error by setting the helm value 'crds.skipVersionCheck=true'.`
