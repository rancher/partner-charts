            CSRFProtection defines a policy for protecting against Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
            If CSRF protection is configured, by default all requests using non-safe HTTP methods (e.g., POST, PUT, DELETE) will be blocked unless their origin matches the host.
            To explicitly allow certain cross-site requests, exceptions may be defined.
