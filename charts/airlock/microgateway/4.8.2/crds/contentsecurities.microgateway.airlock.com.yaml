            ContentSecurity defines a policy for filtering and mutating requests and responses to protect an upstream web application. Individual features can be customized using their dedicated CRDs which are referenced from this policy.

            The default policy is designed to be secure and work with most web applications. Security can be further improved by e.g.,
            - Enforcing an OpenAPI or GraphQL schema to protect API endpoints
            - Enabling CSRF protection
            - Increasing the deny rule strictness level
            - Tightening request limits

            If false positives are encountered (wrongly blocked requests), exceptions may also be configured in the relevant CRDs.
