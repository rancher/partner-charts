--- DEPRECATED ---

This chart has been deprecated. Microgateway 4.8 is the final release with sidecar support which requires the Airlock Microgateway CNI plugin.
This release will be supported for 9 months from publication.
Future Airlock Microgateway releases will only support the sidecarless architecture based on the Kubernetes Gateway API.
