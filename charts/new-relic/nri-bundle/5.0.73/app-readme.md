# New Relic Kubernetes Integration

New Relic's Kubernetes integration gives you full observability into the health and performance of your environment, no matter whether you run Kubernetes on-premises or in the cloud. With our [cluster explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer), you can cut through layers of complexity to see how your cluster is performing, from the heights of the control plane down to applications running on a single pod.

You can see the power of the Kubernetes integration in the [cluster explorer](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/cluster-explorer/kubernetes-cluster-explorer), where the full picture of a cluster is made available on a single screen: nodes and pods are visualized according to their health and performance, with pending and alerting nodes in the innermost circles. [Predefined alert conditions](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/integrations/kubernetes-integration/kubernetes-events/kubernetes-integration-predefined-alert-policy) help you troubleshoot issues right from the start. Clicking each node reveals its status and how each app is performing.
