## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that it honors a wide range of defaults and globals common to most New Relic Helm charts.

Options that can be defined globally include `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `proxy` and others. The full list can be found at
[user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md).
