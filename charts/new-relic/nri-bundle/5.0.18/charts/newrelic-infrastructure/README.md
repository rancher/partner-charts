# newrelic-infrastructure

A Helm chart to deploy the New Relic Kubernetes monitoring solution

**Homepage:** <https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/kubernetes-pixie/kubernetes-integration/get-started/introduction-kubernetes-integration/>

# Helm installation

You can install this chart using [`nri-bundle`](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/nri-bundle) located in the
[helm-charts repository](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts) or directly from this repository by adding this Helm repository:

```shell
helm repo add nri-kubernetes https://newrelic.github.io/nri-kubernetes
helm upgrade --install newrelic-infrastructure nri-kubernetes/newrelic-infrastructure -f your-custom-values.yaml
```

## Values managed globally

This chart implements the [New Relic's common Helm library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/tree/master/library/common-library) which
means that it honors a wide range of defaults and globals common to most New Relic Helm charts.

Options that can be defined globally include `affinity`, `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`, `proxy` and others. The full list can be found at
[user's guide of the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md).

## Chart particularities

### Low data mode
There are two mechanisms to reduce the amount of data that this integration sends to New Relic. See this snippet from the `values.yaml` file:
```yaml
common:
  config:
    interval: 15s

lowDataMode: false
```

The `lowDataMode` toggle is the simplest way to reduce data send to Newrelic. Setting it to `true` changes the default scrape interval from 15 seconds
(the default) to 30 seconds.

If you need for some reason to fine-tune the number of seconds you can use `common.config.interval` directly. If you take a look at the `values.yaml`
file, the value there is `nil`. If any value is set there, the `lowDataMode` toggle is ignored as this value takes precedence.

Setting this interval above 40 seconds can make you experience issues with the Kubernetes Cluster Explorer so this chart limits setting the interval
inside the range of 10 to 40 seconds.

### Affinities and tolerations

The New Relic common library allows to set affinities, tolerations, and node selectors globally using e.g. `.global.affinity` to ease the configuration
when you use this chart using `nri-bundle`. This chart has an extra level of granularity to the components that it deploys:
control plane, ksm, and kubelet.

Take this snippet as an example:
```yaml
global:
  affinity: {}
affinity: {}

kubelet:
  affinity: {}
ksm:
  affinity: {}
controlPlane:
  affinity: {}
```

The order to set an affinity is to set first any `kubelet.affinity`, `ksm.affinity`, or `controlPlane.affinity`. If these values are empty the chart
fallbacks to `affinity` (at root level), and if that value is empty, the chart fallbacks to `global.affinity`.

The same procedure applies to `nodeSelector` and `tolerations`.

On the other hand, some components have affinities and tolerations predefined e.g. to be able to run kubelet pods on nodes that are tainted as master
nodes or to schedule the KSM scraper on the same node of KSM to reduce the inter-node traffic.

If you are having problems assigning pods to nodes it may be because of this. Take a look at the [`values.yaml`](values.yaml) to see if the pod that is
not having your expected behavior has any predefined value.

### `hostNetwork` toggle

In versions below v3, changing the `privileged` mode affected the `hostNetwork`. We changed this behavior and now you can set pods to use `hostNetwork`
using the corresponding [flags from the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md)
(`.global.hostNetwork` and `.hostNetwork`) but the component that scrapes data from the control plane has always set `hostNetwork` enabled by default
(Look in the [`values.yaml`](values.yaml) for `controlPlane.hostNetwork: true`)

This is because the most common configuration of the control plane components is to be configured to listen only to `localhost`.

If your cluster security policy does not allow to use `hostNetwork`, you can disable it control plane monitoring by setting `controlPlane.enabled` to
`false.`

### `privileged` toggle

The default value for `privileged` [from the common library](https://github.com/newrelic/helm-charts/blob/master/library/common-library/README.md) is
`false` but in this particular this chart it is set to `true` (Look in the [`values.yaml`](values.yaml) for `privileged: true`)

This is because when `kubelet` pods need to run in privileged mode to fetch cpu, memory, process, and network metrics of your nodes.

If your cluster security policy does not allow to have `privileged` in your pod' security context, you can disable it by setting `privileged` to
`false` taking into account that you will lose all the metrics from the host and some metadata from the host that are added to the metrics of the
integrations that you have configured.
