# Instana

Instana is an [APM solution](https://www.instana.com/) built for microservices that enables IT Ops to build applications faster and deliver higher quality services by automating monitoring, tracing and root cause analysis.
This solution is optimized for [Kubernetes](https://www.instana.com/automatic-kubernetes-monitoring/).

This chart adds the Instana Agent to all schedulable nodes in your cluster via a privileged `DaemonSet` and accompanying resources like `ConfigurationMap`s, `Secret`s and RBAC settings.

## Prerequisites

* Kubernetes 1.21+ OR OpenShift 4.8+
* Helm 3

## Installation

To configure the installation you can either specify the options on the command line using the **--set** switch, or you can edit **values.yaml**.

First, create a namespace for the instana-agent

```bash
$ kubectl create namespace instana-agent
```

**OpenShift:** When targetting an OpenShift 4.x cluster, ensure proper permission before installing the helm chart, otherwise the agent pods will not be scheduled correctly.

```bash
$ oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z instana-agent
```

To install the chart with the release name `instana-agent` and set the values on the command line run:

```bash
$ helm install instana-agent \
--namespace instana-agent \
--repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
--set agent.key=INSTANA_AGENT_KEY \
--set agent.endpointHost=HOST \
--set zone.name=ZONE_NAME \
--set cluster.name="CLUSTER_NAME" \
instana-agent
```

## Upgrade

The helm chart deploys a Kubernetes Operator internally that reconciles the agent resources based on an agent CustomResource (CR) that is created based on the helm values. As the Operator pattern requires a CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) to be present in the cluster before defining any CRs, the CRD definition is included in the helm chart. On initial installations the chart deploys the CRD before submitting the rest of the artifacts.

Helm has known limitations around handling the CRD lifecycle as outlined in their [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/).

This leads to the problem, that CRD updates are only submitted to the Cluster on **initial installation**, but **NOT applied automatically during upgrades**.

It is also worth noting, that CRDs must be removed manually if the chart should be removed completly, see more details in the [uninstall](#uninstallation) section.

To ensure a proper update, apply the CRD updates before running the upgrade:

```
helm pull --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm --untar instana-agent; kubectl apply -f instana-agent/crds; helm upgrade instana-agent instana-agent \
  --namespace instana-agent \
  --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
  --reuse-values
```

This is especially important when migrating from helm charts v1 to v2, as the upgrade will fail otherwise as the CR artifact cannot be created.

### Required Settings

#### Configuring the Instana Backend

In order to report the data it collects to the Instana backend for analysis, the Instana agent must know which backend to report to, and which credentials to use to authenticate, known as "agent key".

As described by the [Install Using the Helm Chart](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/kubernetes#install-using-the-helm-chart) documentation, you will find the right values for the following fields inside Instana itself:

* `agent.endpointHost`
* `agent.endpointPort`
* `agent.key`

_Note:_ You can find the options mentioned in the [configuration section below](#configuration-reference)

If your agents report into a self-managed Instana unit (also known as "on-prem"), you will also need to configure a "download key", which allows the agent to fetch its components from the Instana repository.
The download key is set via the following value:

* `agent.downloadKey`

#### Zone and Cluster

Instana needs to know how to name your Kubernetes cluster and, optionally, how to group your Instana agents in [Custom zones](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration/#custom-zones) using the following fields:

* `zone.name`
* `cluster.name`

Either `zone.name` or `cluster.name` are required.
If you omit `cluster.name`, the value of `zone.name` will be used as cluster name as well.
If you omit `zone.name`, the host zone will be automatically determined by the availability zone information provided by the [supported Cloud providers](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/cloud_service_agents).

## Uninstallation

To uninstall/delete the `instana-agent` release:

```bash
helm uninstall instana-agent -n instana-agent && kubectl patch agent instana-agent -n instana-agent -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge &&
kubectl delete crd/agents.instana.io
```

### Agent Modes

Agent can have either `APM` or `INFRASTRUCTURE`.
Default is APM and if you want to override that, ensure you set value:

* `agent.mode`

For more information on agent modes, refer to the [Host Agent Modes](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent#host-agent-modes) documentation.

### Agent Configuration

Besides the settings listed above, there are many more settings that can be applied to the agent via the so-called "Agent Configuration File", often also referred to as `configuration.yaml` file.
An overview of the settings that can be applied is provided in the [Agent Configuration File](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#agent-configuration-file) documentation.
To configure the agent, you need to provide the configuration via the `agent.configuration_yaml` parameter in [values.yaml](values.yaml). As all other settings, the Agent configuration is handled by the Operator and stored in Kubernetes Secret resources internally. This way, even plain text passwords are not exposed in any configmap after deployment.

This configuration will be used for all Instana Agents on all nodes. Visit the [agent configuration documentation](https://docs.instana.io/setup_and_manage/host_agent/#agent-configuration-file) for more details on configuration options.

_Note:_ This Helm Chart does not support configuring [Multiple Configuration Files](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#multiple-configuration-files).

### Agent Pod Sizing

The `agent.pod.requests.cpu`, `agent.pod.requests.memory`, `agent.pod.limits.cpu` and `agent.pod.limits.memory` settings allow you to change the sizing of the `instana-agent` pods.
If you are using the [Kubernetes Sensor Deployment](#kubernetes-sensor-deployment) functionality, you may be able to reduce the default amount of resources, and especially memory, allocated to the Instana agents that monitor your applications.
Actual sizing data depends very much on how many pods, containers and applications are monitored, and how much traces they generate, so we cannot really provide a rule of thumb for the sizing.

### Bring your own Keys secret

In case you have automation that creates secrets for you, it may not be desirable for this Helm chart to create a secret containing the `agent.key` and `agent.downloadKey`.
In this case, you can instead specify the name of an alread-existing secret in the namespace in which you install the Instana agent that carries the agent key and download key.

The secret you specify The secret you specify _must_ have a field called `key`, which would contain the value you would otherwise set to `agent.key`, and _may_ contain a field called `downloadKey`, which would contain the value you would otherwise set to `agent.downloadKey`.

### Configuring Additional Configuration Files

[Multiple configuration files](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/configuration#multiple-configuration-files) is a capability of the Instana agent that allows for modularity in its configurations files.

The experimental `agent.configuration.autoMountConfigEntries`, which uses functionality available in Helm 3.1+ to automatically look up the entries of the default `instana-agent` ConfigMap, and mount as agent configuration files in the `instana-agent` container under the `/opt/instana/agent/etc/instana` directory all ConfigMap entries with keys that match the `configuration-*.yaml` scheme.

**IMPORTANT:** Needs Helm 3.1+ as it is built on the `lookup` function
**IMPORTANT:** Editing the ConfigMap adding keys requires a `helm upgrade` to take effect

### Configuring Additional Backends

You may want to have your Instana agents report to multiple backends.
The first backend must be configured as shown in the [Configuring the Instana Backend](#configuring-the-instana-backend); every backend after the first, is configured in the `agent.additionalBackends` list in the [values.yaml](values.yaml) as follows:

```yaml
agent:
  additionalBackends:
  # Second backend
  - endpointHost: my-instana.instana.io # endpoint host; e.g., my-instana.instana.io
    endpointPort: 443 # default is 443, so this line could be omitted
    key: ABCDEFG # agent key for this backend
  # Third backend
  - endpointHost: another-instana.instana.io # endpoint host; e.g., my-instana.instana.io
    endpointPort: 1444 # default is 443, so this line could be omitted
    key: LMNOPQR # agent key for this backend
```

The snippet above configures the agent to report to two additional backends.
The same effect as the above can be accomplished via the command line via:

```sh
$ helm install -n instana-agent instana-agent ... \
    --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[0].endpointHost=my-instana.instana.io' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[0].endpointPort=443' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[0].key=ABCDEFG' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[1].endpointHost=another-instana.instana.io' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[1].endpointPort=1444' \
    --set 'agent.additionalBackends[1].key=LMNOPQR' \
    instana-agent
```

_Note:_ There is no hard limitation on the number of backends an Instana agent can report to, although each comes at the cost of a slight increase in CPU and memory consumption.

### Configuring a Proxy between the Instana agents and the Instana backend

If your infrastructure uses a proxy, you should ensure that you set values for:

* `agent.proxyHost`
* `agent.pod.proxyPort`
* `agent.pod.proxyProtocol`
* `agent.pod.proxyUser`
* `agent.pod.proxyPassword`
* `agent.pod.proxyUseDNS`

#### Same Proxy for Repository and the Instana backend

If the same proxy is utilized for both backend and repository, configure only the 'Agent' proxy settings  using the following parameter:
 ```
  --set agent.proxyHost='<Hostname/address of a proxy>' 
 ```

#### Separate Proxies for Repository and the Instana backend

In scenarios where distinct proxy settings are employed for the backend and repository, both proxies must be configured separately. The key is to ensure that `INSTANA_REPOSITORY_PROXY_ENABLED=true` is set.

To use this variant, execute helm install with the following additional parameters:

```
--set agent.proxyHost='Hostname/address of a proxy'
--set agent.env.INSTANA_REPOSITORY_PROXY_ENABLED='true'
--set agent.env.INSTANA_REPOSITORY_PROXY_HOST='Hostname/address of a proxy'
```
Make sure to replace 'Hostname/address of a proxy' with the actual hostname or address of your proxy.

### Configuring which Networks the Instana Agent should listen on

If your infrastructure has multiple networks defined, you might need to allow the agent to listen on all addresses (typically with value set to `*`):

* `agent.listenAddress`

### Setup TLS Encryption for Agent Endpoint

TLS encryption can be added via two variants.
Either an existing secret can be used or a certificate and a private key can be used during the installation.

#### Using existing secret

An existing secret of type `kubernetes.io/tls` can be used.
Only the `secretName` must be provided during the installation with `--set 'agent.tls.secretName=<YOUR_SECRET_NAME>'`.
The files from the provided secret are then mounted into the agent.

#### Provide certificate and private key

On the other side, a certificate and a private key can be added during the installation.
The certificate and private key must be base64 encoded.

To use this variant, execute `helm install` with the following additional parameters:

```
--set 'agent.tls.certificate=<YOUR_CERTIFICATE_BASE64_ENCODED>'
--set 'agent.tls.key=<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_BASE64_ENCODED>'
```

If `agent.tls.secretName` is set, then `agent.tls.certificate` and `agent.tls.key` are ignored.

### Development and debugging options

These options will be rarely used outside of development or debugging of the agent.

| Parameter               | Description                                      | Default |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| `agent.host.repository` | Host path to mount as the agent maven repository | `nil`   |

### Kubernetes Sensor Deployment

 _Note: leader-elector and kubernetes sensor are fully deprecated and can no longer be chosen. Instead, the k8s_sensor will be used._

The Helm chart will schedule additional Instana agents running _only_ the Kubernetes sensor that runs in a dedicated `k8sensor` Deployment inside the `instana-agent` namespace.
The pods containing agents that run only the Kubernetes sensor are called `k8sensor` pods.
When `k8s_sensor.deployment.enabled=true`, the `instana-agent` pods running inside the daemonset do _not_ contain the `leader-elector` container, which is instead scheduled inside the `k8sensor` pods.

The `instana-agent` and `k8sensor` pods share the same configurations in terms of backend-related configurations (including [additional backends](#configuring-additional-backends)).

The `k8s_sensor.deployment.pod.requests.cpu`, `k8s_sensor.deployment.pod.requests.memory`, `k8s_sensor.deployment.pod.limits.cpu` and `k8s_sensor.deployment.pod.limits.memory` settings, allow you to change the sizing of the `k8sensor` pods.

### Multiple Zones

You can list zones to use affinities and tolerations as the basis to associate a specific daemonset per tainted node pool. Each zone will have the following data:

* `name` (required) - zone name.
* `mode` (optional) - instana agent mode (e.g. APM, INFRASTRUCTURE, etc).
* `affinity` (optional) - standard kubernetes pod affinity list for the daemonset.
* `tolerations` (optional) - standard kubernetes pod toleration list for the daemonset.

The following is an example that will create 2 zones an api-server and a worker zone:

```yaml
zones:
  - name: workers
    mode: APM
  - name: api-server
    mode: INFRASTRUCTURE
    affinity:
      nodeAffinity:
        requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
                - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane
                  operator: Exists
    tolerations:
    - key: "node-role.kubernetes.io/master"
      operator: "Exists"
      effect: "NoSchedule"
```

### Volumes and volumeMounts

You can define volumes and volumeMounts in the helm configuration to make files available to the agent pod, e.g. to provide client certificates or custom certificate authorities for a sensor to reach a monitored target.

Example:

An application requires the usage of a customer provided java key store (JKS) to interact with a monitored process, e.g. IBM MQ. The keystore file is created as secret in the cluster.

To create the secret, the file can be uploaded with the Kubernetes `kubectl` or Openshift `oc` command line tools.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic keystore-secret-name --from-file=./application.jks -n instana-agent
```

Create a custom values file for the helm installation, e.g. `custom-values.yaml` and adjust the following content accordingly.

```yaml
agent:
  pod:
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /opt/instana/agent/etc/application.jks
      name: jks-mount
      subPath: application.jks
    volumes:
    - name: jks-mount
      secret:
        secretName: keystore-secret-name
```

To deploy the helm chart with the custom mount, specify the configuration as additional parameter.

```bash
helm install instana-agent \
  --repo https://agents.instana.io/helm \
  --namespace instana-agent \
  --set agent.key='<your_agent_key>' \
  --set agent.endpointHost='<your_host_agent_endpoint>' \
  --set agent.endpointPort=443 \
  --set cluster.name='<your_cluster_name>' \
  --set zone.name='<your_zone_name>' \
  -f custom-values.yaml \
  instana-agent
```

See [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) for other examples of volume options.


The mounted file will be available inside the agent pods after the installation.

```
$ kubectl exec instana-agent-xxxxx -- ls /opt/instana/agent/etc/application.jks
/opt/instana/agent/etc/application.jks
```

### 1.2.18 / 1.2.19

* Internal change on generated DaemonSet YAML from the Helm charts

  actually causes the Agent deployment to fail when these policies are enforced in the cluster.

### 1.2.16

* Add configuration option for `INSTANA_MVN_REPOSITORY_URL` setting on the Agent container.

### 1.2.15

* Internal pipeline changes. No significant changes to the Helm charts

### v1.2.14

* Update Agent container mounts. Make some read-only as we don't need all mounts with read-write permissions.
    Additionally add the mount for `/var/data` which is needed in certain environments for the Agent to function
    properly.

### v1.2.13

* Update memory settings specifically for the Kubernetes sensor (Technical Preview)

### v1.2.11

* Simplify setup for using OpenTelemetry and the Prometheus `remote_write` endpoint using the `opentelemetry.enabled` and `prometheus.remoteWrite.enabled` settings, respectively.

### v1.2.9

* **Technical Preview:** Introduce a new mode of running to the Kubernetes sensor using a dedicated deployment.
  See the [Kubernetes Sensor Deployment](#kubernetes-sensor-deployment) section for more information.

### v1.2.7

* Fix: Make service opt-in, as it uses functionality (`topologyKeys`) that is available only in K8S 1.17+.

### v1.2.6

* Fix bug that might cause some OpenShift-specific resources to be created in other flavours of Kubernetes.

### v1.2.5

* Introduce the `instana-agent:instana-agent` Kubernetes service that allows you to talk to the Instana agent on the same node.

### v1.2.3

* Bug fix: Extend the built-in Pod Security Policy to cover the Docker socket mount for Tanzu Kubernetes Grid systems.

### v1.2.1

* Support OpenShift 4.x: just add --set openshift=true to the usual settings, and off you go :-)
* Restructure documentation for consistency and readability
* Deprecation: Helm 2 is no longer supported; the minimum Helm API version is now v2, which will make Helm 2 refuse to process the chart.

### v1.1.10

* Some linting of the whitespaces in the generated YAML

### v1.1.9

* Update the README to replace all references of `stable/instana-agent` with specifically setting the repo flag to `https://agents.instana.io/helm`.
* Add support for TKGI and PKS systems, providing a workaround for the [unexpected Docker socket location](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/kubo-release/issues/329).

### v1.1.7

* Store the cluster name in a new `cluster-name` entry of the `instana-agent` ConfigMap rather than directly as the value of the `INSTANA_KUBERNETES_CLUSTER_NAME`, so that you can edit the cluster name in the ConfigMap in deployments like VMware Tanzu Kubernetes Grid in which, when installing the Instana agent over the [Instana tile](https://www.instana.com/docs/setup_and_manage/host_agent/on/vmware_tanzu), you do not have directly control to the configuration of the cluster name.
If you edit the ConfigMap, you will need to delete the `instana-agent` pods for its new value to take effect.

### v1.1.6

* Allow to use user-specified memony measurement units in `agent.pod.requests.memory` and `agent.pod.limits.memory`.
  If the value set is numerical, the Chart will assume it to be expressed in `Mi` for backwards compatibility.
* Exposed `agent.updateStrategy.type` and `agent.updateStrategy.rollingUpdate.maxUnavailable` settings.

### v1.1.5

Restore compatibility with Helm 2 that was broken in v1.1.4 by the usage of the `lookup` function, a function actually introduced only with Helm 3.1.
Coincidentally, this has been an _excellent_ opportunity to introduce `helm lint` to our validation pipeline and end-to-end tests with Helm 2 ;-)

### v1.1.4

* Bring-your-own secret for agent keys: using the new `agent.keysSecret` setting, you can specify the name of the secret that contains the agent key and, optionally, the download key; refer to [Bring your own Keys secret](#bring-your-own-keys-secret) for more details.
* Add support for affinities for the instana agent pod via the `agent.pod.affinity` setting.
* Put some love into the ArtifactHub.io metadata; likely to add some more improvements related to this over time.

### v1.1.3

* No new features, just ironing some wrinkles out of our release automation.

### v1.1.2

* Improvement: Seamless support for Instana static agent images: When using an `agent.image.name` starting with `containers.instana.io`, automatically create a secret called `containers-instana-io` containing the `.dockerconfigjson` for `containers.instana.io`, using `_` as username and `agent.downloadKey` or, if missing, `agent.key` as password. If you want to control the creation of the image pull secret, or disable it, you can use `agent.image.pullSecrets`, passing to it the YAML to use for the `imagePullSecrets` field of the Daemonset spec, including an empty array `[]` to mount no pull secrets, no matter what.

### v1.1.1

* Fix: Recreate the `instana-agent` pods when there is a change in one of the following configuration, which are mapped to the chart-managed ConfigMap:

* `agent.configuration_yaml`
* `agent.additional_backends`

The pod recreation is achieved by annotating the `instana-agent` Pod with a new `instana-configuration-hash` annotation that has, as value, the SHA-1 hash of the configurations used to populate the ConfigMap.
This way, when the configuration changes, the respective change in the `instana-configuration-hash` annotation will cause the agent pods to be recreated.
This technique has been described at [1] (or, at least, that is were we learned about it) and it is pretty cool :-)

### v1.1.0

* Improvement: The `instana-agent` Helm chart has a new home at `https://agents.instana.io/helm` and `https://github.com/instana/helm-charts/instana-agent`!
This release is functionally equivalent to `1.0.34`, but we bumped the major to denote the new location ;-)
