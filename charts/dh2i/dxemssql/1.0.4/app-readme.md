# Availability Groups With DxEnterprise

DxEnterprise (DxE) uses Microsoft SQL Server Availability Groups clustering technology to dramatically reduce the complexity of configuring and managing highly available SQL Server AGs. DxEnterprise makes AGs highly available within containers without relying on WSFC or any other cumbersome and restrictive cluster orchestration technologies, while also providing advanced fault detection and failover automation to minimize outages for SQL Server databases, helping customers achieve nearest-to-zero total downtime. DxEnterprise AGs enable cross-network failover without opening external ports or the use of virtual private networks (VPNs), enabling simplified cross-network, cross-zone, and cross-region clusters. 

- SDP-enhanced highly available SQL Server Availability Groups
- Realtime health detection and automatic failover
- Discreet and secure networking across AG nodes in separate sites, regions, or clouds - without a VPN
- Management simplicity and minimal complexity
