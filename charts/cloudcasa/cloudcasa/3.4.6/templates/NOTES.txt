Please be patient while the CloudCasa agent is being deployed. It may take several minutes.

The agent is configured with cluster ID: {{ .Values.clusterID }}

Once the agent completes startup, the state shown for the cluster in the CloudCasa Clusters/Overview
page will change to "Active". If the cluster stays in the "Registered" or "Pending" state, you may have provided the wrong ClusterID.

{{- if eq .Values.server.address "agent.cloudcasa.io:443" }}
For SaaS deployments, visit: https://home.cloudcasa.io/clusters/overview
{{- else }}
For self-hosted deployments, check your CloudCasa instance's UI at the appropriate URL for your self-hosted environment.
{{- end }}

You can check the agent deployment status using the command: kubectl get pods -n cloudcasa-io
