Please be patient while the CloudCasa agent is being deployed. It may take several minutes.

The agent is configured with cluster ID: {{ .Values.cluster_id }}

Once the agent completes startup, the state shown for the cluster in the CloudCasa Clusters/Overview
page (https://home.cloudcasa.io/clusters/overview) will change to "Active".
If the cluster stays in the "Registered" or "Pending" state, you may have provided the wrong ClusterID.

You can check the agent deployment status using the command: kubectl get pods -n cloudcasa-io
