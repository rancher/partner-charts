-----Please be patient while the chart is being deployed-----

Tip: Watch the App deployment status using the command: kubectl/oc get pods -n cloudcasa-io

Monitor the Cloudcasa UI, the registered cluster state should be moved to Ready State. If the cluster is still in Pending state, wrong ClusterID would have been provided.
