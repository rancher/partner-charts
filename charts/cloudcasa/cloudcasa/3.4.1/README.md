# CloudCasa Kubernetes Agent

[CloudCasa](https://cloudcasa.io) - Leader in Kubernetes Data Protection and Application Resiliency

# Introduction

CloudCasa is a SaaS data protection, recovery, and migration solution for Kubernetes. Configuration is quick and easy, and the basic service is free.

CloudCasa provides two types of backup services for Kubernetes: 
* **CloudCasa for Velero** provides centralized management and monitoring, guided recovery, and commercial support for existing Velero backup installations.
* **CloudCasa Pro** provides centralized backup services for large, complex, multi-cluster, multi-cloud, and hybrid cloud environments. It includes multi-cloud account integration, managed backup storage, and advanced cross-cloud recovery.

Whether you are managing existing Velero installations or using the advanced Pro features, with CloudCasa you donâ€™t need to be a storage or data protection expert to back up and restore your Kubernetes clusters.

This Helm chart installs and configures the CloudCasa agent on a Kubernetes cluster.
See the CloudCasa [Getting Started Guide](https://cloudcasa.io/get-started) for more information.

## Prerequisites

1. Kubernetes 1.17+
2. Helm 3.0+

## Installation

### Rancher Installation (Apps & Marketplace)

1. Log in to https://home.cloudcasa.io and add your Kubernetes cluster under the Protection tab. Note the returned cluster ID.
2. Go to Apps & Marketplace in the Rancher UI. In the Chart section, check the Partners checkbox and click on the CloudCasa chart.
3. Provide a Name (e.g. CloudCasa) and optional description.
4. In the CloudCasa Configuration section, provide the Cluster ID obtained above.
5. Click on the Install button to complete installation of the agent.
6. Click on Upgrade version to upgrade the existing helmchart. 
 
**Note**: Validate the existence of four CRDS viz. volumesnapshotlocations.velero.io, volumesnapshotcontents.snapshot.storage.k8s.io, volumesnapshots.snapshot.storage.k8s.io and volumesnapshotclasses.snapshot.storage.k8s.io. If any one of the crds doesnt exist, execute the edit/upgrade operation.

### Helm CLI Installation

1. Log in to https://home.cloudcasa.io and add your Kubernetes cluster under the Protection tab. Note the returned cluster ID.
2. Execute the following helm commands, replacing ```<ClusterID>``` with the Cluster ID obtained above:
    ```
    $ helm repo add cloudcasa-repo https://catalogicsoftware.github.io/cloudcasa-helmchart
    $ helm install cloudcasa.io cloudcasa-repo/cloudcasa --set cluster_id=<Cluster ID>
    ```
This will install the CloudCasa agent and complete registration of the cluster with the CloudCasa service.

## Updating the CloudCasa Agent
1. Log in to https://home.cloudcasa.io and obtain the cluster ID for your cluster by selecting it under the Protection tab.
2. Execute the following commands to update the agent:
    ```

    $ helm upgrade cloudcasa.io cloudcasa-repo/cloudcasa --set cluster_id=<Cluster ID>
    ```

**Note**: Validate the existence of four CRDS viz. volumesnapshotlocations.velero.io, volumesnapshotcontents.snapshot.storage.k8s.io, volumesnapshots.snapshot.storage.k8s.io and volumesnapshotclasses.snapshot.storage.k8s.io. If any one of the crds doesnt exist, again execute the upgrade command.
