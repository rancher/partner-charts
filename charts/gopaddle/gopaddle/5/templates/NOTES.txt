===================================

Congratulations on installing gopaddle!

You are now ready to access the Kubernetes IDE. Hereâ€™s how:

Step 1: Wait for gopaddle pods to move to READY state: `kubectl wait --for=condition=ready pod -l released-by=gopaddle -n gopaddle`

Step 2: Get the Cluster IP - Run the following command to find your cluster's IP address: `kubectl get nodes -o wide`

Step 3: Access the gopaddle UI - Open your web browser and go to: `http://<cluster-node-ip>:30003`. Replace `<cluster-node-ip>` with the IP address you obtained in Step 2.

For Docker Desktop Users: If you are using Docker Desktop Kubernetes Engine, you need to forward the port to access the gopaddle service. Run: `kubectl port-forward svc/gopaddle-service -n gopaddle 30003:65080`

Then, open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:30003`

Enjoy using gopaddle!
