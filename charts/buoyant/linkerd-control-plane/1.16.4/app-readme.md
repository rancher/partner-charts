# Linkerd 2 Chart

Linkerd is an ultra light, ultra simple, ultra powerful service mesh. Linkerd
adds security, observability, and reliability to Kubernetes, without the
complexity.

This particular chart only installs the control plane core. To gain access to
the observability features, please install the linkerd-viz chart. Other
extensions are available (multicluster, jaeger) under the linkerd Helm repo.
