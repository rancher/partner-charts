# Portworx

[Portworx](https://portworx.com/) is a software defined persistent storage solution designed and purpose built for applications deployed as containers, via container orchestrators such as Kubernetes, Marathon and Swarm. It is a clustered block storage solution and provides a Cloud-Native layer from which containerized stateful applications programmatically consume block, file and object storage services directly through the scheduler.

## Pre-requisites
The helm chart (portworx-helm) deploys Portworx and Stork (https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/stork.html) on your Kubernetes cluster. The minimum requirements for deploying the helm chart are as follows:

- Helm has been installed on the client machine from where you would install the chart (https://docs.helm.sh/using_helm/#installing-helm).
- Tiller version 2.9.0 and above is running on the Kubernetes cluster where you wish to deploy Portworx.
- Tiller has been provided with the right RBAC permissions for the chart to be deployed correctly.
- Kubernetes 1.7+
- All [pre-requisites](https://docs.portworx.com/install-portworx/prerequisites/) for Portworx fulfilled.

## Upgrading the Chart from an old chart with Daemonset
1. Deploy StorageCluster CRD. 
Helm does not handle CRD upgrade, let's manually deploy it.
```
kubectl apply -f ./charts/portworx/crds/core_v1_storagecluster_crd.yaml
```
2. Run helm upgrade with the original values.yaml that was used to deploy the Daemonset chart.
```
helm upgrade [RELEASE] [CHART] -f values.yaml
```
3. Review the StorageCluster spec. If any value is not expected, change values.yaml and run `helm upgrade` to update it.
```
kubectl -n kube-system describe storagecluster
```
4. Approve the migration
```
kubectl -n kube-system annotate storagecluster --all --overwrite portworx.io/migration-approved='true'
```
5. Wait for migration to complete
Describe the StorageCluster to see event `Migration completed successfully`. If migration fails, there is corresponding event about the failure.
```
kubectl -n kube-system describe storagecluster
```
6. Rollback to Daemonset (Unsupported)

Use `helm rollback` to rollback to Daemonset install is not supported, if there is any issue during migration please try to update values.yaml and perform `helm upgrade`. 

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` run the following commands substituting relevant values for your setup:

##### NOTE:
Upgrading from previous versions to 4.0.0 is not backward compatible. Please review the values configuration for the latest release.

`internalKVDB` is set to `true` by default. Portworx would by default use internal kvdb.

To use an external KVDB, you can provide the `etcdEndPoint`
If the etcd cluster being used is a secured etcd (SSL/TLS) then please follow instructions to create a kubernetes secret with the certs. https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/etcd-certs-using-secrets.html#create-kubernetes-secret


`clusterName` should be a unique name identifying your Portworx cluster. The default value is `mycluster`, but it is suggested to update it with your naming scheme.

For eg:
```
git clone https://github.com/portworx/helm.git
helm install --debug --name my-release --set clusterName=$(uuidgen) ./helm/charts/portworx/
```

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

## Cloud installs

#### Installing on AKS 

Details are [here](https://docs.portworx.com/portworx-install-with-kubernetes/cloud/azure/aks/2-deploy-px/).

> **Tip**: In this case the chart is located at `./helm/charts/portworx`, do change it as per your setup.
```
helm install --name my-release --set imageVersion=1.2.12.0,etcdEndPoint=etcd:http://192.168.70.90:2379 ./helm/charts/portworx/
```

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,
```
helm install --name my-release -f ./helm/charts/portworx/values.yaml ./helm/charts/portworx
```
> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) and make changes as per your requirement

#### Installing on IKS [ IBM Cloud ] 

Refer the IBM charts [here](https://github.com/IBM/charts/tree/master/community/portworx)

> **Tip**: You will need to add the IBM charts repo with the repo path set to rawgithub
```
helm repo add ibm-porx https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/charts/master/repo/community
```

## Upgrading Portworx Install

You can update the `imageVersion` value in the YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters used while installing the chart.
```
helm upgrade my-release -f ./helm/charts/portworx/values.yaml ./helm/charts/portworx
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `--set` directive to do the same. For example,
```
helm upgrade my-release --set imageVersion=<px-version>,etcdEndPoint=<list-of-etcd-endpoints>,clusterName=<cluster-name> -f ./helm/charts/portworx/values.yaml  ./helm/charts/portworx 
```

> **Tip**: You can check the upgrade with the new values took effect using. Check the reference for upgrade [here](https://v2.helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#helm-upgrade-and-helm-rollback-upgrading-a-release-and-recovering-on-failure)
```
helm get values my-release
```

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:
The chart would follow the process as outlined here. (https://docs.portworx.com/scheduler/kubernetes/install.html#uninstall)

> **Tip** > The Portworx configuration files under `/etc/pwx/` directory are preserved, and will not be deleted.

```
helm delete my-release
```
The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

### Basic troubleshooting

#### Helm install errors with `no available release name found`

```
helm install --dry-run --debug --set etcdEndPoint=etcd:http://192.168.70.90:2379,clusterName=$(uuidgen) ./helm/charts/portworx/
[debug] Created tunnel using local port: '37304'
[debug] SERVER: "127.0.0.1:37304"
[debug] Original chart version: ""
[debug] CHART PATH: /root/helm/charts/portworx

Error: no available release name found
```
This most likely indicates that Tiller doesn't have the right RBAC permissions.
You can verify the tiller logs
```
[storage/driver] 2018/02/07 06:00:13 get: failed to get "singing-bison.v1": configmaps "singing-bison.v1" is forbidden: User "system:serviceaccount:kube-system:default" cannot get configmaps in the namespace "kube-system"
