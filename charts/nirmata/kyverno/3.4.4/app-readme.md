# Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno

## User Documentation for Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K)

**Nirmata Enterprise for Kyverno (N4K)** is Nirmataâ€™s enterprise-grade distribution of Kyverno. While N4K is fully compatible with Kyverno OSS, it provides the peace of mind and reliability of an enterprise-grade solution.

### Key Features

- **24x7 Support**  
  N4K provides the peace of mind to get 24x7 emergency support from experts, which is essential for production and business-critical workloads. Technical support is available using a variety of channels such as phone, email, and messaging.

- **Long-Term Version Compatibility**  
  N4K provides two years of Long-Term Support (LTS) for compatibility across Kyverno and Kubernetes versions. This means that you will get critical fixes and CVE support for a given Kyverno release for up to two years.  
  Comparatively, with the open-source version, critical fixes and CVEs are managed as best effort and are supported only up to n-1 releases.  
  In addition, N4K supports a wider range of Kubernetes versions compared to Kyverno OSS, meaning that a given N4K release, and all policy sets, will be tested across all the supported Kubernetes versions.  
  ðŸ‘‰ _Check out the [Release Compatibility Matrix](https://docs.nirmata.io/docs/n4k/release-compatibility-matrix/) for details._

- **Prioritized Fixes and Feature Requests**  
  Nirmata is an open-source first company. We aim to collaborate in the open and all features are built in the community and are part of the Kyverno project.  
  Having said that, our customers enjoy the benefits of a fast-track for their issues and feature requests. The Nirmata team will work with the community to get your feature requests and fixes into the upstream to maintain compatibility and parity.

- **Curated Policy Sets**  
  There are pre-built policies (300+) that cover common security concerns and improve the overall security posture of Kubernetes clusters.

- **Training and Support**  
  With the enterprise version, there will be continued training and support.  
  Quarterly training sessions along with upgrade assistance and best practice assessments will help teams get a better understanding of critical components and new features.  
  You can even use your training hours towards custom policy authoring, for optimized policies that perform well and scale to your needs.

- **Extensions for Enterprise Integration**  
  Optionally, with N4K, adapters are used to extend the capabilities of Kyverno that help in enforcing complex and sophisticated policies.
