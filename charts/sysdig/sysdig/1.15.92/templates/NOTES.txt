The agent for Sysdig Secure DevOps Platform is spinning up on each node in your
cluster. After a few seconds, you should see your hosts appearing in the
Sysdig Agent Health & Status Dashboard:

COLLECTOR_URL: This value is region-dependent in SaaS and is auto-completed in install snippets in the UI. (It is a custom value in on-prem installations.)
API_ENDPOINT: This is the base URL (region-dependent) for Sysdig Secure and is auto-completed in install snippets in the UI. E.g. secure.sysdig.com, us2.app.sysdig.com, eu1.app.sysdig.com.

These are few example links (valid for us-east only):
