entity, “You”) and the licensor defined in Section 15.0 (“Licensor”), which sets forth the rights
and obligations governing software products defined in the licensing policy (“Software”), limited
support services, and associated documentation (“Documentation”). By installing, using, or
otherwise interacting with the Software or Documentation, delivering, or receiving services, You
agree to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If You do not agree with the terms of this EULA,

1.0 License Grant.
This EULA grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable
right to install and use the Software in object code form and also the Documentation for Your
internal business purposes under the terms and conditions stated herein.

1.1 The Software is to be used in accordance with the specific license You purchased; a
description of the license can be found at https://www.veeam.com/licensing-
policy.html (“Licensing Policy”). You may only use the number of licenses or capacity that You
have purchased unless the product specifically allows You to exceed usage by a certain amount.
In the event You exceed the purchased capacity, the Software may not process additional
workloads, and Licensor is not required to provide maintenance or support for such excess use
unless You purchase additional licenses.

1.2 You are permitted to make copies of the Software and Documentation for Your own use in
accordance with this EULA and the Licensing Policy. Any copies or partial copies of the
Software and Documentation that You make remain Licensor's intellectual property and must
incorporate all relevant patent, copyright and trademark notices.

Without Licensor’s express prior written consent, You may not (directly or
indirectly through any employee, contractor, consultant, agent or other representative): (a) resell,
transfer, share, or make the Software or Your license keys available to any third party (including,
without limitation, sharing license keys on any website, forum or social media); (b) process
third-party data (as a service provider), provide commercial hosting or support services,
sublicense, rent or lease, in whole or in part, the Software to another party, or otherwise use the
Software on a service bureau basis, without purchasing a specific license to do so; (c) decipher,
decompile, disassemble, reverse assemble, reverse engineer, modify, or otherwise attempt to

Maintenance and support (collectively, “Maintenance”) for the
Software is available in accordance with the Licensing Policy and Licensor’s support policy (the
“Support Policy”), which can be found at https://www.veeam.com/support.html. Maintenance, if
it is included in the Software purchased, will commence upon the date Your order is processed
and the license file is generated. You will receive (a) support for Your Software and (b) any
updates, enhancements, or improvements that are included or defined in the Support Policy.
Software updates cannot be applied to the Software with an expired Maintenance plan. Licensor
can postpone or reject providing Maintenance if You violate any provisions of this EULA and/or
Licensing Policy.

4.0 Technical Information Collection.

4.1 Licensor cannot access the Software installed in Your chosen environment(s) or any data that
You manage using the Software. Licensor cannot access any technical information pertaining to
the configuration or performance of the Software unless You voluntarily provide it to Licensor
by uploading log files, sharing screenshots, descriptions, reports, survey information, etc.,
pertaining to the Software use or utilize the Assistant (as defined in Section 10.0 below).
Additional information and requirements regarding Your use of the Assistant are set forth in
Section 10.0 below.

4.2 Licensor products that support automatic license updates generate and send license usage
statistics to Licensor. THIS FUNCTIONALITY IS TURNED ON BY DEFAULT AND CAN
BE DISABLED AT ANY TIME. The license usage data collection is mandatory for all Free and
Community Edition licenses and cannot be disabled.

4.3 Certain Licensor products require online licensing services accessibility for license activation
and/or usage reporting due to the protected platform’s requirements. THIS DATA
COLLECTION IS ALWAYS ON AND CANNOT BE DISABLED.

5.0 Personal Information.
In the event You voluntarily provide personal data to Licensor in
connection with Maintenance or otherwise, Your personal information will be used and stored in
accordance with Licensor’s Privacy Notice, which can be found
at https://www.veeam.com/privacy-policy.html. You can always update Your preferences by
visiting the Licensor customer portal.

6.0 Intellectual Property Rights.
The Software is LICENSED, NOT SOLD. The Software is
protected by patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and other laws, including, without
limitation, international treaties. A list of relevant patents and trademarks can be found
at https://www.veeam.com/veeam-patents-and-registered-trademarks.html. All rights, title, and
interest in and to the Software, Documentation, and any other Licensor materials or information
provided or made available in connection with this EULA, as well as all suggestions, ideas, and
feedback You propose regarding the foregoing, are owned by Licensor (or any third-party
licensor), and You hereby assign any right, title, and interest in and to any such suggestions,
ideas or feedback to Licensor. Third-party licensors, in addition to any other rights or remedies
available to them, are third-party beneficiaries of this EULA with regard to their respective
component(s).

7.0 Open Source Software.
Licensor may include various open source software components in
or with the Software (collectively, “OSS”), each of which is owned by a third-party and is
subject to its own applicable license terms and conditions. A current list of OSS components
used by Licensor can be found at https://www.veeam.com/eula-oss.html. All OSS is provided on
an “as-is” basis, and Licensor makes no express or implied warranties of any kind with respect
thereto and assumes no liability for any damages regarding the use or operation of any such OSS.

8.0 Export Compliance.
The Software and Documentation may be subject to export or import
regulations and sanctions imposed by various countries, including, but not limited to, the U.S.,
E.U., U.K., U.N., and other relevant authorities (“Export and Sanctions Regulations”). You must
comply with all applicable Export and Sanctions Regulations. You agree to be solely responsible
for determining the legality of exporting, re-exporting, or importing the Software and
Documentation.
You confirm that you will not directly or indirectly sell, export, re-export, or use the Software
and Documentation in the Russian Federation, the Republic of Belarus, or in any manner that
would violate applicable US and EU export control laws. Furthermore, You commit to using
Your best efforts to prevent any third parties in the supply chain from violating these terms.
Additionally, by using the Software and Documentation, You affirm that neither You nor Your
customers are:

individuals or entities in countries or regions subject to comprehensive sanctions
(currently, Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, the Crimea region of
Ukraine, and the Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporizhzhia regions of Ukraine.
You must immediately notify Licensor of any actual or potential non-compliance with these
Export and Sanctions Regulations, including any unauthorized use or sale by third parties.
Violation of these terms will be considered a material breach of this EULA, entitling us to
terminate the EULA immediately, in addition to other legal remedies available to Licensor.

9.0 Audit.
During the term of the EULA and for a period of one year thereafter, Licensor may,
during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice to You, inspect Your files,
computer processors, equipment, and facilities to verify Your compliance with the terms and
conditions of this EULA, including but not limited to all license terms, policies, and quantities
purchased via authorized Licensor resellers or online marketplaces. The scope of the audit may
encompass the verification of compliance with this EULA as a whole, which by reference
includes the Licensing Policy.
Licensor may conduct such an audit no more than once per year unless there are reasonable
grounds for the audit, such as suspected breaches of the EULA. The audit may be conducted in
any form, including online requests for information (logs) or by inspecting Your infrastructure,
by itself and/or with the involvement of third parties at Licensor’s discretion. In case of such an
audit, You must provide Licensor and/or any third party selected by Licensor the requested
information (logs) and/or access to Your infrastructure within thirty (30) days after receiving the
Licensor’s notice and make reasonable efforts to facilitate the audit.
Any information received by Licensor as a result of the audit shall be treated as confidential and
be used solely for the purposes of performing the audit. Should the audit reveal that You are in
breach of any terms of this EULA, the costs of the audit conducted by a third party will be borne
by You.

10.0 AI-enabled Assistant.

10.1 Some Software may contain an artificial intelligence (“AI”)-enabled assistant trained to
provide You with assistance regarding use of the Software (the “Assistant”). Use of this feature
is subject to the AI Terms of Use. By using the Assistant, You acknowledge and agree that, in
addition to the terms of this Section 10.0, You have read, understand and agree to comply with
the AI Terms of Use. You further agree that Licensor is not responsible for the Assistant’s output
or any information that You input into the Assistant. You may not use the Assistant for any
purpose other than to seek information about the Software’s functionality. You agree that under
no circumstances will You or any user in Your organization input to the Assistant information
that is considered “personal information” or “personal data” (as those or similar terms are
defined under any laws applicable to You) or information that Your organization considers
confidential or non-public. The Assistant is based on Azure OpenAI Service from Microsoft
Corporation. All input You share with this Assistant will be processed in accordance
with Microsoft’s Azure OpenAI Terms and this EULA. By using the Assistant, You acknowledge
and agree that You have read, understand and agree to comply with those terms. Before using the
Assistant, please review that documentation, and You may not use the Assistant if You do not
agree to those terms. In some Software, the Assistant may have two modes: basic (“Basic
Mode”), which only utilizes information You input to the chat window, and advanced
(“Advanced Mode”), which utilizes information You input to the chat window and product data
received from the Software (the combined information, “Mixed Input”). Basic Mode is turned on
by default. Advanced Mode is turned off by default, and You need to turn it on explicitly. The
Software also includes an option to completely disable the Assistant.

10.2 In Basic Mode, Licensor may store and review any input You share with the Assistant and
the Assistant’s output in order to improve the Assistant’s functionality or as otherwise necessary
or useful for Licensor to provide its services. Licensor will delete all stored input and output after
30 days from the store date.

10.3 In Advanced Mode, Mixed Input is deleted immediately after You close the conversation
session or the session times out. Licensor may store and review the Assistant’s output (but not
Mixed Input) in order to improve the Assistant’s functionality or as otherwise necessary or useful
for Licensor to provide its services. Licensor will delete all stored output after 30 days from the
store date.

10.4 Licensor does not review all of the Assistant’s output; if the Assistant is unable to answer
Your question or if You have any concerns regarding its output, You may contact Licensor’s
customer support personnel.

11.0 Indemnification.
Licensor will defend or, at its option, settle any action, suit or proceeding
against You that is based upon a claim that Your use of the Software infringes any patent,
copyright or other intellectual property right of a third party, and will indemnify You against any
amounts awarded against You as a result of the claim, suit or proceeding; provided that (a)
Licensor is promptly notified of the assertion of the claim, suit or proceeding, (b) Licensor has
sole control of its defense and/or settlement, and (c) You provide reasonable assistance and
cooperate in Licensor’s defense and/or settlement, at Licensor’s expense. Licensor’s defense and
indemnity obligations do not apply, and You shall be responsible for the defense and/or
settlement of any claims where (1) Your use of the Software or Documentation is beyond the
scope of license granted in this EULA or otherwise in violation of any of the terms or conditions
set forth in this EULA or any terms, policies or information referenced or to which a link has
been provided in this EULA, (2) You modified or created derivative works from the Software or
Documentation, (3) You used an outdated and infringing version of the Software or
Documentation after release of a non-infringing version by Licensor, (4) You used or combined
the Software with any technology, software or hardware not supplied by Licensor, where the
alleged infringement would not have occurred absent such use or combination, or (5) Your use of
the Evaluation Licenses or Free and Community Edition Licenses. In the event any such
infringement action, suit, or proceeding is brought or threatened, Licensor will, at its sole option
and expense: (i) procure for You the right to continue the use of the Software or the allegedly
infringing part thereof; or (ii) modify or amend or replace the same with other software or
material having substantially similar functionality and performance.

12.0 Limited Warranty and Limitations of Liability.

12.1 The purchase of the Software license (perpetual or subscription) is non-returnable and non-
refundable. Licensor warrants that the Software, in its unmodified form as initially delivered or
made available to You, will perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation for
such Software for a warranty period of ninety (90) days from the date the Software is delivered
to You (the “Warranty Period”). In the event the Software fails in a material respect to operate in
accordance with the Documentation during the Warranty Period and Licensor is unable to correct
the defect, Licensor’s sole and exclusive liability and Your sole and exclusive remedy shall be a
refund of the license fees, if any, paid by You for the Software. All claims must be raised within
the Warranty Period. The foregoing limited warranty will not apply to Evaluation Licenses or
Free and Community Edition Licenses, that are always provided “as is”, or if failure of the
Software is the result of damage or misuse You caused. In the event a reported problem with the
Software is Your fault, You agree to reimburse Licensor for its correction efforts in accordance
with its then standard rates.

12.2 For any  Evaluation Licenses and Free and Community Edition Licenses in no event will
Licensor be liable for any damages, for any claim or cause for any damages of any kind,
including, without limitation, any direct, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, statutory,
punitive or consequential damages (including, without limitation, loss of profits, loss of use or
data, damage to systems or equipment or business interruption). You are not entitled to any
defense, indemnification, or warranty protection for licenses granted pursuant to Section 12.1.
12.3 EXCEPT FOR THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 12.1, THE
SOFTWARE AND MAINTENANCE ARE PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY THAT THE SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED, IS MERCHANTABLE, OR FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. NO
ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ANY
THIRD PARTY, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY LICENSOR
DISTRIBUTORS OR RESELLERS, SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTY IN ADDITION
TO, OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF, THIS LIMITED WARRANTY.
WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE FOREGOING, ALL USE OF THE
ASSISTANT BY YOU OR ANY OF YOUR PERSONNEL SHALL BE AT YOUR SOLE
RISK.

12.4 IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS BE
LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY, STATUTORY,
PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND (INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF USE OR DATA, DAMAGE TO SYSTEMS OR
EQUIPMENT, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR COST OF COVER) IN CONNECTION
WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THE DELIVERY, PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE
SOFTWARE (INCLUDING THE ASSISTANT) OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR
MAINTENANCE PROVIDED BY LICENSOR UNDER THIS EULA, WHETHER ALLEGED
AS A BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM OR AS ANOTHER TYPE OF CLAIM,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, CLAIMS FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT, UNFAIR
COMPETITION OR BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR OTHER TORTIOUS CONDUCT,
INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. LICENSOR’S MAXIMUM
AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS EULA, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE (INCLUDING THE
ASSISTANT) OR ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR MAINTENANCE PROVIDED BY
LICENSOR UNDER THIS EULA, AND LICENSOR’S RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU SHALL
NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY YOU TO LICENSOR FOR THE
SOFTWARE DURING THE ONE (1) YEAR PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE THE
APPLICABLE CAUSE OF ACTION AROSE.

12.5 NO ACTION ARISING OUT OF ANY BREACH OR CLAIMED BREACH OF THIS
EULA OR TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS EULA MAY BE BROUGHT BY
EITHER PARTY MORE THAN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION HAS
ACCRUED. FOR PURPOSES OF THIS EULA, A CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE
DEEMED TO HAVE ACCRUED WHEN A PARTY KNEW OR REASONABLY SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN OF THE BREACH OR CLAIMED BREACH.
