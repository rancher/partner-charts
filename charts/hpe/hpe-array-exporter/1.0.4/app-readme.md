# HPE Storage Array Exporter for Prometheus

The [HPE Storage Array Exporter for Prometheus](https://hpe-storage.github.io/array-exporter) provides storage system information in the form of [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics. It can be used in combination with [HPE CSI Info Metrics Provider for Prometheus](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/metrics.html) metrics to focus on storage resources used within a Kubernetes cluster.
