# HPE CSI Info Metrics Provider for Prometheus

The [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](https://github.com/hpe-storage/csi-driver) may be accompanied by a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics endpoint to provide metadata about the volumes provisioned by the CSI driver and supporting backends. It's conventionally deployed with [HPE Storage Array Exporter for Prometheus](https://hpe-storage.github.io/array-exporter/) to provide a richer set of metrics from the backend storage systems.
