# HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes Helm chart

The [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/index.html) leverages Hewlett Packard Enterprise primary storage platforms to provide scalable and persistent storage for stateful and ephemeral applications. Currently supported storage platforms include HPE GreenLake for Block Storage powered by HPE Alletra Storage MP B10000, HPE Alletra 5000/6000/9000, HPE Nimble Storage, HPE Primera and HPE 3PAR.

## Release highlights

The HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes Helm chart is the primary delivery vehicle for the HPE CSI Driver.

- All resources for the HPE CSI Driver is available on [HPE Storage Container Orchestrator Documentation](https://scod.hpedev.io/) (SCOD).
- Visit [the latest release](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/index.html#latest_release) on SCOD to learn what's new in this chart.
- The release notes for the HPE CSI Driver are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/hpe-storage/csi-driver/tree/master/release-notes).

## Prerequisites

- Most recent Kubernetes distributions are supported
- Recent Ubuntu, SLES or RHEL (and its derives) compute nodes connected to their respective official package repositories
- Helm 3 (Version >= 3.2.0 required)

Refer to [Compatibility & Support](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/index.html#compatibility_and_support) for currently supported versions of Kubernetes and compute node operating systems.

Depending on which [Container Storage Provider](https://scod.hpedev.io/container_storage_provider/index.html) (CSP) is being used, other prerequisites and requirements may apply, such as storage platform OS and features.

`*` = Disabling node conformance and configuration may prevent the CSI driver from functioning properly. See the [manual node configuration](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/operations.html#manual_node_configuration) section on SCOD to understand the consequences.
`**` = The default value is the current well tested upper limit. Do not increase the default value unless the use case has been well tested.

It's recommended to create a [values.yaml](https://github.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/blob/master/helm/values/csi-driver) file from the corresponding release of the chart and edit it to fit the environment the chart is being deployed to. Download and edit [a sample file](https://github.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/blob/master/helm/values/csi-driver).

**Note:** The chart is installed with all components and features enabled using reasonable defaults if no tweaks are needed.

### Installing the chart

To install the chart with the name `my-hpe-csi-driver`:

Add HPE helm repo:

```
helm repo add hpe-storage https://hpe-storage.github.io/co-deployments/
helm repo update
```

Install the latest chart:

```
helm install --create-namespace -n hpe-storage my-hpe-csi-driver hpe-storage/hpe-csi-driver
```

**Note**: By default, the latest stable chart will be installed. If it's labeled with `prerelease` and a "beta" version tag, add `--version X.Y.Z-beta` to the command line to install a "beta" chart.

### Upgrading the chart

Due to the [helm limitation](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/#some-caveats-and-explanations) to not support upgrade of CRDs between different chart versions, helm chart upgrade is not supported.
Our recommendation is to uninstall the existing chart and install the chart with the desired version. CRDs will be preserved between uninstall and install.

#### Upgrading 2.0.0 to 2.1.0

Before version 2.0.0 is uninstalled, the following CRDs needs to be updated. 

**Important:** If there are HPE Alletra Storage MP B10000, Alletra 9000, Primera or 3PAR Remote Copy Groups configured on the cluster, follow the [next steps](#update-rcg-info) before uninstallation.

##### Update RCG Info

This step is only necessary if there are HPE Alletra Storage MP B10000, Alletra 9000, Primera or 3PAR Remote Copy Groups configured on the cluster. If there are none, proceed to the [next step](#update-crds).

Change kubectl context into the Namespace where the HPE CSI Driver is installed. The most common is "hpe-storage".

```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=hpe-storage
```

Create the Job using the below commands, which will modify the "rcg-info" record to the new key "RCGCreatedByCSP".

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/master/yaml/rcg-info/v1.0.0/convert-rcg-info.yaml
```

Completion of job status can be verified using the below command.

```
kubectl wait --for=condition=complete --timeout=600s job/primera3par-rcg-info
```

Continue to [update the CRDs](#update-crds) followed by [uninstalling the chart](#uninstalling-the-chart).

##### Update CRDs

Before reinstallation of the driver, apply the new CRDs.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/master/helm/charts/hpe-csi-driver/crds/hpevolumeinfos_v2_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/master/helm/charts/hpe-csi-driver/crds/hpevolumegroupinfos_v2_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/master/helm/charts/hpe-csi-driver/crds/snapshotgroupinfos_v2_crd.yaml
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/master/helm/charts/hpe-csi-driver/crds/hpereplicated_deviceinfo_v2_crd.yaml
```

#### Uninstalling the chart

To uninstall the `my-hpe-csi-driver` chart:

```
helm uninstall my-hpe-csi-driver -n hpe-storage
```

**Note**: Due to a limitation in Helm, CRDs are not deleted as part of the chart uninstall.

## Using persistent storage with Kubernetes

Enable dynamic provisioning of persistent storage by creating a `StorageClass` API object that references a `Secret` which maps to a supported HPE primary storage backend. Refer to the [HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes](https://scod.hpedev.io/csi_driver/deployment.html#add_a_hpe_storage_backend) documentation on SCOD. Also, it's helpful to be familiar with [persistent storage concepts](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/) in Kubernetes prior to deploying stateful workloads.

## Support

The HPE CSI Driver for Kubernetes Helm chart is fully supported by HPE.

Formal support statements for each HPE supported CSP is [available on SCOD](https://scod.hpedev.io/legal/support). Use this facility for formal support of your HPE storage products, including the Helm chart.

## Community

Please file any issues, questions or feature requests you may have [here](https://github.com/hpe-storage/co-deployments/issues) (do not use this facility for support inquiries of your HPE storage product, see [SCOD](https://scod.hpedev.io/legal/support) for support). You may also join our Slack community to chat with HPE folks close to this project. We hang out in `#Alletra`, `#NimbleStorage`, `#3par-primera`, and `#Kubernetes`.
