# Kubeslice Controller

## Introduction

The KubeSlice Controller orchestrates the creation and management of slices on worker clusters.
The KubeSlice Controller components and the worker cluster components can coexist on a cluster. Hence, the cluster running the KubeSlice controller can also be used as a worker cluster.

The user is required to register themselves to receive a token that is required to install the KubeSlice Controller and Worker Operator.

Instructions for registration will be provided during the installation steps.
