                description: Filters is an experimental field that conforms to the
                  CNCF CloudEvents Subscriptions API. It's an array of filter expressions
                  that evaluate to true or false. If any filter expression in the
                  array evaluates to false, the event MUST NOT be sent to the Subscriber.
                  If all the filter expressions in the array evaluate to true, the
                  event MUST be attempted to be delivered. Absence of a filter or
                  empty array implies a value of true. In the event of users specifying
                  both Filter and Filters, then the latter will override the former.
                  This will allow users to try out the effect of the new Filters field
                  without compromising the existing attribute-based Filter and try
                  it out on existing Trigger objects.
