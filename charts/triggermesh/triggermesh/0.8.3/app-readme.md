# TriggerMesh Cloud Native Integration Platform

The [TriggerMesh Cloud Native Integration Platform](https://github.com/triggermesh/triggermesh) consists of a set of APIs which allow you to build event-driven applications with [Knative](https://knative.dev). Implemented as a set of Kubernetes CRDs and a Kubernetes controller, TriggerMesh gives you a way to declaratively define your event sources and event targets, in addition to potential actions needed in your applications: content-based event filtering, event splitting, event transformation and event processing via functions.
