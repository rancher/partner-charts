# Availability Groups With DxEnterprise

DxEnterprise (DxE) uses Microsoft SQL Server Availability Groups clustering technology to dramatically reduce the complexity of configuring and managing highly available SQL Server AGs. DxEnterprise makes AGs highly available within containers without relying on WSFC or any other cumbersome and restrictive cluster orchestration technologies. DxE provides advanced fault detection and failover automation to minimize outages for SQL Server databases, helping customers achieve nearest-to-zero total downtime. 

DxEnterprise also supports cross-platform failover between Windows machines and Linux machines or containers. DxEnterprise AGs enable cross-network failover without opening external ports or the use of virtual private networks (VPNs), enabling simplified cross-network, cross-zone, and cross-region clusters. This also reduces the complexity and cost of running hybrid clusters between on-premises and the cloud, and makes it easier to take advantage of Microsoft's SQL Server licensing rules that allow for "free" HA and DR secondary replicas for deployments with Software Assurance.
