# Datawiza Access Broker

Datawiza Access Broker is a distributed, lightweight, container-based Identity Aware proxy deployed close to your application via the sidecar or standalone mode. It provides a unified authentication and authorization layer, decoupled from the application itself. As a container, it can be deployed on-premise and in the cloud as long as the environment supports Docker containers.
