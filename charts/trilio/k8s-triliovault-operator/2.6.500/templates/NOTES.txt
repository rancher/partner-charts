TrilioVault Operator is a helm based operator which install/upgrade/delete the helm Chart of the TrilioVault For Kubernetes.
This operator watches over the entire helm application of TrilioVault for Kubernetes and has self-healing capabilities.

To verify that TrilioVault Operator has started, run:

    kubectl --namespace={{ .Release.Namespace }} wait --for=condition=ready pod -l "release={{ .Release.Name }}"

Once the Triliovault operator is in running state, you can create the TrilioVault for Kubernetes(TVK) with the
following custom resource:

    apiVersion: triliovault.trilio.io/v1
    kind: TrilioVaultManager
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: triliovault
      name: tvk
      namespace: {{ .Release.Namespace }}
    spec:
      trilioVaultAppVersion: latest
      applicationScope: Cluster
      ingressConfig:
        host: "trilio.net"
      componentConfiguration:
        ingress-controller:
          enabled: true
          service:
            type: LoadBalancer

Once the above CR has been created, you have to wait for the TVK pods to come up. To check all the pods come into
running state, run:

    kubectl --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} wait --for=condition=ready pod -l "release=tvk-{{ .Release.Namespace }}"

Once all the pods are in running state, you can access the TVK UI from your browser at:

    https://trilio.net

Note: The host `trilio.net` is used from the `ingressConfig.host` defined in the TVM CR by the user.

You can start backup and restore of your application using TVK. For more details on how to do that, please follow our
