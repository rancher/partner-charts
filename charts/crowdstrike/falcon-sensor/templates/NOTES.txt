Thank you for installing the CrowdStrike Falcon Helm Chart!

Access to the Falcon Linux and Container Sensor downloads at registry.crowdstrike.com are
required to complete the install of this Helm chart. If an internal registry is used instead of registry.crowdstrike.com.
the containerized sensor must be present in a container registry accessible from Kubernetes installation.
{{- if .Values.node.enabled }}
CrowdStrike Falcon sensors will deploy across all nodes in your Kubernetes cluster after
installing this Helm chart. The default image name to deploy a kernel sensor to a node is `falcon-node-sensor`.
{{- end }}

{{- if .Values.container.enabled }}
CrowdStrike Falcon sensors will deploy across all pods as sidecars in your Kubernetes cluster after
installing this Helm chart and starting a new pod deployment for all your applications.
The default image name to deploy the pod sensor is `falcon-sensor`.
{{- end }}

When utilizing your own registry, an extremely common error on installation is accidentally forgetting to add your containerized
sensor to your local image registry prior to executing `helm install`. Please read the Helm Chart's readme
for more deployment considerations.

{{ if and (.Capabilities.APIVersions.Has "security.openshift.io/v1") .Values.container.enabled -}}
If deploying the Falcon Container Sensor on Red Hat OpenShift, push the Falcon Container sensor image
after you install the Helm Chart if you are using OpenShift's internal registry.
This is due to OpenShift requiring a valid ImageStream Tag to pull from a valid image hash in
the internal registry.
