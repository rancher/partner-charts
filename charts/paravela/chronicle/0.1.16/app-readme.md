Chronicle records provenance information of any physical or digital asset on a distributed ledger.

- Chronicle is available with Hyperledger Sawtooth as its default backing ledger.
- Chronicle is built on the established W3C PROV Ontology standard; it uses the lightweight JSON-LD linked data format, and the data query language GraphQL.
- Chronicle is easily adaptable to enable users to model, capture, and query provenance information pertinent to their industry, application and use case.

## *Important*

*As Chronicle uses Sawtooth as its backing ledger, a minimum of 4 nodes is required for deployment.*
*This helm chart will deploy and configure a 4 node Sawtooth network on your target cluster, so less than 4 nodes will result in the deployment failing.*
