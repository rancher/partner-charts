description: 'This helm chart installs the Digitalis Vals Operator to manage and sync
  secrets from supported backends into Kubernetes. ## About Vals-Operator Here at
  [Digitalis](https://digitalis.io) we love [vals](https://github.com/helmfile/vals),
  it''s a tool we use daily to keep secrets stored securely. Inspired by this tool,
  we have created an operator to manage Kubernetes secrets. *vals-operator* syncs
  secrets from any secrets store supported by [vals](https://github.com/helmfile/vals)
  into Kubernetes. Also, `vals-operator` supports database secrets as provider by
  [HashiCorp Vault Secret Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/databases). '
