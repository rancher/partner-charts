# partner-charts

This repository is reserved for partner charts in Rancher's v2.5+ catalog. Its
helm charts are based on upstream charts. Rancher-specific modifications are
applied to these charts, and overlay files may be added as well. These charts
are then served from this repository so that they are available within Rancher.

## Requirements

* Chart must be Helm 3 compatible.

    Helm 2 installed CRDs via an `helm.sh/hook: crd-install` annotation that installed
    CRDs via a special hook. In Helm 3, this annotation was removed in favor of a `crds/`
    directory where your CRDs should now reside. Templating and upgrading CRDs is also no
    longer supported by default. Users who need to support templating / upgrading CRDs should
    use a separate CRD chart that installs the CRDs via the `templates/` directory instead.
    Leaving this hook in your chart will not cause it to break, but will cause the Helm logs
    to emit the warning `manifest_sorter.go:175: info: skipping unknown hook: "crd-install"`
    on an install or upgrade.

    In addition, starting [Helm 3.5.2](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.5.2), Helm is stricter about parsing semver strings. Therefore, to ensure that your chart is deployable via Helm 3.5.2, your chart must have a semver-compliant version.

    More information:
    * Supported Hooks: https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/
    * Helm 2 to 3 migration: https://helm.sh/docs/topics/v2_v3_migration/
    * Managing CRDs and best practices: https://helm.sh/docs/chart_best_practices/custom_resource_definitions/
    * Semver Rules: https://semver.org/

* Chart must be in a hosted [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/) (recommended) or Git repository that we can reference.

* Chart must have the following Rancher specific add-ons (More details on this below).
    * kubeVersion set in the chart's metadata
    * app-readme.md
    * questions.yml (Optional)

## Workflow

#### 1. Fork the [Rancher Partner Charts](https://github.com/rancher/partner-charts/) repository, clone your fork, checkout the **main-source** branch and pull the latest changes. 
Then create a new branch off of main-source

#### 2. Create subdirectories in **packages** in the form of `<vendor>/<chart>`
```bash
cd partner-charts
mkdir -p packages/suse/kubewarden-controller

```
#### 3. Create your [upstream.yaml](#configuration-file) in `packages/<vendor>/<chart>`

The tool reads a configuration yaml, `upstream.yaml`, to know where to fetch the upstream chart. This file is also able to define any alterations for valid variables in the Chart.yaml as described by [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#the-chartyaml-file).

**Important:** In GKE clusters, a Helm Chart will NOT display in Rancher Apps unless `kubeVersion` includes `-0` suffix in `Chart.yaml` For example:
```bash
kubeVersion: '>= 1.19.0-0'  
```
Some [example upstream.yaml](#examples) are provided below
```bash
cat <<EOF > packages/suse/kubewarden-controller/upstream.yaml
HelmRepo: https://charts.kubewarden.io
HelmChart: kubewarden-controller
Vendor: SUSE
DisplayName: Kubewarden Controller
ChartMetadata:  
  icon: https://www.kubewarden.io/images/icon-kubewarden.svg
EOF
```
#### 4. [Create 'overlay' files](#overlay)
Create any add-on files such as an `app-readme.md` and `questions.yml` in an `overlay` subdirectory (Optional)
```bash
mkdir packages/suse/kubewarden-controller/overlay
echo "Example app-readme.md" > packages/suse/kubewarden-controller/overlay/app-readme.md
```
#### 5. Commit your packages directory
```bash
git add packages/suse/kubewarden-controller
git commit -m "Submitting suse/kubewarden-controller"
```
#### 6. [Test your configuration](#testing-your-configuration)
#### 7. Push your commit
```bash
git push origin <your_branch>
```
#### 8. Open a pull request to **main-source** branch


## Testing your configuration
If you would like to test your configuration using the CI tool, simply run the provided script in `scripts/pull-scripts` to download the binary. The 'auto' function is what will be run to download and store your chart.

#### 1. Download the binary
```bash
scripts/pull-scripts
```
#### 2. Set the **PACKAGE** environment variable to your chart
You can confirm the package entry with `bin/partner-charts-ci list` which will list all detected charts with a configuration file.
```bash
export PACKAGE=<vendor>/<chart>
```
#### 3. Run the 'auto' or 'stage' function
The 'auto' subcommand will run the complete CI process.
The 'stage' subcommand will do the same process but will not create a git commit when it completes.
```bash
bin/partner-charts-ci auto
```
#### 4. Validate your changes
```bash
bin/partner-charts-ci validate
```
#### Testing new chart on Rancher Apps UI
1. If you haven't done so yet, pull down your new chart files into your local `partner-charts` repository:
```bash
a) Get scripts: scripts/pull-scripts
b) List and find your company name/chart: bin/partner-charts-ci list | grep <vendor>
c) set PACKAGE variable to your company/chart: export PACKAGE=<vendor>/<chart-name> or export PACKAGE=<vendor>
d) Run bin/partner-charts-ci stage or auto # the new charts should be downloaded
```
2.  In your local `partner-charts` directory start a python3 http server:
```bash
#python3 -m http.server 8000
```
3. From a second terminal expose your local http server via ngrok ( https://ngrok.com/download )
```bash
#./ngrok http 8000
```
4. In Rancher UI create a test repository that points to your local `partner-charts` repo by selecting an appropriate cluster and going to Apps > Repositories and clicking "Create".  Enter a Name, copy ngrok forwarding url and paste it into Target http(s) "Index URL" and click "Create" again.

5. Once the new repository is "Active" go to Apps > Charts , find your new chart, review Readme is correct, etc. and install it. It should be successfully deployed.

## Overlay

Any files placed in the `packages/<vendor>/<chart>/overlay` directory will be overlayed onto the chart. This allows for adding or overwriting files within the chart as needed. The primary intended purpose is for adding the optional app-readme.md and questions.yml files but it may be used for adding or replacing any chart files.

- `app-readme.md` - Write a brief description of the app and how to use it. It's recommended to keep
it short as the longer `README.md` in your chart will be displayed in the UI as detailed description.

- `questions.yml` - Defines a set of questions to display in the chart's installation page in order for users to
answer them and configure the chart using the UI instead of modifying the chart's values file directly.

#### Questions example
[Variable Reference](https://docs.ranchermanager.rancher.io/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/helm-charts-in-rancher/create-apps#question-variable-reference)

  required: true
  type: password
  label: Admin Password
  group: "Global Settings"
- variable: service.type
  default: "ClusterIP"
  type: enum
  group: "Service Settings"
  options:
    - "ClusterIP"
    - "NodePort"
    - "LoadBalancer"
  required: true
  label: Service Type
  show_subquestion_if: "NodePort"
  subquestions:
  - variable: service.nodePort
    default: ""
    description: "NodePort port number (to set explicitly, choose port between 30000-32767)"
    type: int
    min: 30000
    max: 32767

## Migrate existing chart to automated updates
These steps are for charts still using `package.yaml` to track upstream chart.  These charts should be migrated to receive automatic updates via an `upstream.yaml` by following the steps below.  After chart is migrated, it should get updated from your helm/github repo automatically.

#### 1. Fork partner-charts repository, clone your fork, checkout the main-source branch and pull the latest changes. Then create a new branch off of main-source

#### 2. Create directory structure for your company and chart in `packages/<vendor>/<chart>` e.g.
```bash
mkdir -p partner-charts/packages/suse/kubewarden-controller
```
#### 3. Create an `upstream.yaml` in `packages/<vendor>/<chart>` 
If your existing chart is using a high patch version like 5.5.100 due to old method of taking version 5.5.1 and modifying it with the PackageVersion, add `PackageVersion` to the `upstream.yaml` (set it to 01 , 00 is not valid). Ideally, when the the next minor version is released e.g. 5.6.X you can then remove `PackageVersion` from the `upstream.yaml` since 5.6.X > 5.5.XXX.  E.g.
```yaml	
cat <<EOF > packages/suse/kubewarden-controller/upstream.yaml
HelmRepo: https://charts.kubewarden.io
HelmChart: kubewarden-controller
Vendor: SUSE
DisplayName: Kubewarden Controller
PackageVersion: 01 # add if existing chart is using high patch version
ChartMetadata:
  kubeVersion: '>=1.21-0'
  icon: https://www.kubewarden.io/images/icon-kubewarden.svg
EOF 
```
#### 4. If there is an `overlay` dir in `partner-charts/packages/<chart>/generated-changes/` move it to `packages/<vendor>/<chart>/` and ensure only necessary files are present in overlay dir e.g.
```bash
mv partner-charts/packages/kubewarden-controller/generated-changes/overlay partner-charts/packages/suse/kubewarden-controller/
```
Check the old generated-changes/patch directory for any requisite other changes. If there is an edit in `Chart.yaml.patch` that needs to be replicated, it can be handled in the `upstream.yaml` `ChartMetadata` (see https://github.com/rancher/partner-charts#configuration-file).  If it is a change for any other file in the chart it can be done via an overlay file. See https://github.com/rancher/partner-charts#overlay  

#### 5. Clean up old packages and charts directories:
```bash
git rm -r packages/<chart>
git rm -r charts/<chart>
```
* Note: If a chart is using a logo file in partner-charts repo, make sure the `icon:` variable is set correctly in the `upstream.yaml ChartMetadata`. 

#### 6. Stage your changes (To make sure the config works, and to setup the new charts and assets directories)
```bash
export PACKAGE=<vendor>/<chart>
bin/partner-charts-ci stage
```
#### 7. Move the old assets files to the new directory (Sometimes this is unchanged but most times it does change)
```bash
git mv assets/<chart>/* assets/<vendor>/
```
#### 8. Update the `index.yaml` to reflect the new assets path for existing entries
```bash
sed -i 's%assets/<chart>%assets/<vendor>%' index.yaml
```
After doing this,  run this loop to validate that every assets file referenced in the index actually exists, it makes sure your paths aren't edited incorrectly.
```bash
for charts in $(yq '.entries[][] | .urls[0]' index.yaml); do stat ${charts} > /dev/null; if [[ ! $? -eq 0 ]]; then echo ${charts}; fi; done
```
The command should return quickly with no output. If it outputs anything it means some referenced assets files don't exist which is a problem.
#### 9. Add/Commit your changes
```bash
git add assets charts packages index.yaml
git commit -m "Migrating <vendor> <chart> chart"
```
#### 10. Push your commit
```bash
git push origin <your branch>
```
#### 11. Open a pull request  to the `main-source` branch for review
